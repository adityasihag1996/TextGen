thus far this album has provided musical accompaniment to make your passing pleasant 
 our next number is designed to drown out the sound of shovels 
 music to be buried by	black magic night walker  
 she haunts me like no other  
 nobody told me  love is pain oh  
 black magic dark water  
 surrounds me like no other  
 shes got my heart in chains 
  
  
 were volatile i cant call it though 
 its like too large a peg and too small a hole  
 but she cheats and i catch her like the common cold  
 last time i broke her collar bone shes intolerabl  
 all i know is that the sex is phnomenal though 
 were an unlikely pair  
 like two different nike airs 
 but im the same size she wears  
 so i think were soulmates though  
 people dont like us together but like we care  
 yeah but god strike me dead  
 she knows that i would walk over hot coals 
 for her with both of my feet bare  
 but soon as i ask to hit  
 its like she grabs a switch  
 and turns me over her knee 
 cause my ass is whipped yeah 
 and i got her back but im spineless  
 so when she stabs me in mine  
 its like i just cant feel the knife  
 as she pokes jabs it and slices 
 one minute shell build me up  
 the next shell push me round 
 probably why she calls me dumbbell 
 she lifts me up  then puts me down  
 but i am under her thumbnail 
 i must be under her spell 
 its like lookin right into a gun barrel 
 but none of these hoes can fuck with my girl 
 she got that 
  
 black magic night walker 
 she haunts me like no other 
 nobody told me love is pain oh 
 black magic dark water 
 surrounds me like no other 
 shes got my heart in chains 
  
  
 we wake up break up make up like maybelline 
 now shes all made up like makebelieve 
 probably why shes so fake to me 
 but what the fucks it gonna take for me to make her see 
 strip her naked and take her keys 
 i been plannin this day for weeks 
 but i cant tell if im wake or sleep 
 but if this is actually happenin sucker for pain 
 im stuck in this radioactive pattern 
 but her by her motherfuckin hairs 
 all i imagine draggin  
 she lunges attacks and scratches 
 but i aint gonna stand for that shit 
 like kaep for the national anthem 
 as i stab im laughin 
 so much for witchcraft and magic 
 abracadabra that bitch 
 no turnin back im blackin 
 as i say farewell to the love of my life i cut and i slice 
 i give her one last hug goodbye 
 wipe the blood off my butterfly knife 
 watch her fuckin die right in front of my eyes 
 but in hindsight 
 think i just wanted to see what her insides look like 
 as i pop another five vics 
 thats what this highs like 
 look down theres mud on my nikes 
 shovel at my side blood on my mic 
 now wake up to music to be murdered by like	before i check the mic  
 i give it a extra swipe with a lysol disinfectant wipe  
 coronavirus in effect tonight 
 antiseptics on deck i got every type  
 i throw on my tux then i  give zero fucks then i  
 act like a jockstrap  cup my nuts then i  
 check my ball hair  make sure its all there  
 then call the pallbearer  
 its music to b murdered by again why stop 
 overkill lik a pipe bomb in your pine box 
 youre all hitched to my cock  
 went from punchin a time clock to getting my shot 
 then treated it like a cyclops 
 like its the only one i  got 
 and my thoughts are like nines cocked  
 every lines obscene pervertedest mind got the dirtiest rhyme stocked 
 thats why theres parental advising  every time i drop  
 so throw on the theme to alfred ill channel him like the panama canal 
 but how could i get up in arms about you saying trash is all that i put out 
 bitch i still get the bag when im putting garbage out 
 plus the potty mouth im not about to wash it out 
 the filthiest so all this talk about im washed up how preposterous 
 because if cleanliness is next to godliness 
 its obvious that its impossible for me to be beside myself 
 and im bout that capital like a proper noun 
 still on top the pile 
 got me sitting on numbers like a pocket dial 
 quick to call you out on your bullshit 
 dont make me give that crock a dial 
 cause if i do it see you later alligator 
 made it out the trailer then i made a vow to cater to no one 
 so hate ive gained about the same amount thats in my bank account 
 so heres some more shit for you to complain about i say the 
 bars that never slack  but always get attacked  
 i think theyre gunnin for me its startin to feel like that 
 like im marked cause when i rap its like fallin on my back in a tar pit 
 cause i have this target on my back  
 but if i ever doublecrossed my fans and lost my stans 
 id probably pop five xans  
 go in my garage start my van 
 inhale as much carbon monoxide and exhaust i can 
 and doze off like snores 
 but odds like that with these thoughts i haves like a giant getting squashed by ants 
 if this is the test of time id pass with flying colors 
 like i just tossed my crayons  
 small medium and large size cans 
 sanitizers of all types brands cost nine bands 
 which is a small price for lysol wipes and 
 if my palms brush across my pants i wash my hands 
  
 shit hold on man 
 motherfucker 
 happy birthday to 
 fuck  
  
  
 i sit in silence in candlelit environments 
 sipping wild irish while getting violent 
 homicidal visions when im spitting like this 
 but really im just fulfilling my wish of killing rhymes 
 which is really childish and silly but im really like this 
 im giving nightmares to billie eilish im diddys side bitch 
  
  
 what the fuck hold on wait 
 im diddys side bitch 
 oh im still east side bitch 
  
  
 so til the end since epmd 
 been givin yall the business  dre and me  
 from the mmlp to mtbmb  
 bitch its 2020 you still aint seein me  
 so call me santa claus  
 cause at the present  i outrap em all  im at the mall 
 got your bitch in a bathroom stall she could suck a basketball  
 through a plastic straw  with a fractured jaw  
 my dick is coat check  she wanna jack it off  
 im so far past the bar i should practice law 
 mentally im fucked up generally   
 dukes of hazzard car  get the cadaver dogs 
 cause this is murder murder and youll get murked murked 
 this music bout to kill you brr brr  
 this chicken hit my phone she said chirp chirp 
 i said hut hut hike your skirt skirt 
 then go eat some worms like the early bird 
 what the fuck is love thats a dirty word 
 make me fall in it theres not a girl on earth 
 or any other planet thats a world of hurt 
 and i wont buy a designer cause i dont pander  
 but im back with so many knots i need a chiropractor  
 and this the final chapter  cause im either frying after  
 or they gon give me the needle  like a vinyl scratcher  
 yeah im a card like hallmark 
 at walmart with a small cart buying wall art 
 and yall who claim to be dogs arent 
 no bite like a tree mostly just all bark arf arf 
 but yall pickin the wrong tree they call me dog because im barking  
 and i got a lot yeah like where cars park 
 id describe it as bowling  ball hard  
 cause the gutters where my mind is and when 
 its in this frame better split like the five and the ten 
 cause without a second to spare im strikin again 
 and when the beat is up my alley i go right for the pens  
 the cypher begins 
 im talkin smack like heroin the mics a syringe 
 its like a binge vicodin i would liken to tin 
 my mind is a recycling bin 
 theres no place i never been 
 but i never budge and i never bend 
 you hyperextend on me this games life it depends 
 like adult diapers for men 
 even when im rappin less stellar 
 its sour grapes i still whine im the best seller  
 like a trey deuce spray you as these shots penetrate through dres booth 
 and go straight through your grapefruit no escape route 
 so you wont leave here just scathed with a few scrape wounds 
 your ass is grass and i am not gonna graze you 
 but if bars were semimacs id be the mad hatter 
 cause i got so many caps and you dont have any straps  
 so youd be a fitted  so dont act like you fittin to snap 
 bitch ill pee  on your head like a phillies hat  
 no stoppin me youre on a window shopping spree 
 bitch you probably go broke at the dollar tree 
 you never buy shit all you ever cops a plea 
 youre always punkin out like halloween 
 you rather opt to flee you need to stop it punk 
 homie youre not a g act like you got the pump 
 and youre gonna cock the heat or get the glock and dump 
 bitch if you shot a tree you wouldnt pop the trunk 
 yeah and im buddies with alfred we about to 
 disembowel them gut em and scalp em yeah 
 this is bout to be the bloodiest outcome 
 cause we gon make you bleed with every cut from this album 
 so im choppin em up like dahmer 
 the nut job with the nuts that are bigger than jabba the hutt 
 im in the cut and im out for the blood 
 its lookin like its that time of the month 
 carvin em up with the bars while i sharpen em up dog and a mutt 
 im gonna fuck your mom in the butt with a thermometer fuckin phenomenal but 
 yallll get cut the fuck up like abdominals if you dont vmonos 
 i keep droppin like dominos the formidable abominable 
 stompin a mudhole in my comp even if its off the top of the dome

 oh i cant hear you 
 i have an ear infucktion and i cunt finger it out  yeah

 its my alter egos fault 
 these evil thoughts could be so dark 
 cerebral palsy three zolofts 
 i eat doze off to rico suave  
 cadillac with a ladder rack in the back with a cracked axel a backpack full of paxil 
 a black satchel a knapsack and a flask full of gnac and jack daniels 
 girl lets go backback to my castle  
 i dont wanna hassle you alexandra 
 but my dicks an acronym cause it stands for you

 i been a lab rat  from a test tube  
 im goin innn like the red roof  
 you dont like it eat a cock til your jaw breaks  
 call it caught between a rock and a hard place 
 like a sasquatch in a crawlspace 
 cause youre watchin your heart race like youre scarface 
 in a car chase with the cops or an arcade 
 stuck inside of a mario kart race duckin saw blades 
 at a stop and a start pace 
 what im tryin to say is im drivin em all crazy 
  
 i cant understand a word you say  
 i think this way i prefer to stay  
 i wont stop even when my hair turns grey  
 cause they wont stop until they cancel me  
  
  
 i see the rap game then attack the verses  
 turn into a graveyard packed with hearses  
 just like your funeral im at your service  
 pockets on stuff like a taxidermist  
 just landed in los angeles when this chick angela and her grandmother in a tan 
 colored van pull up with a handful of xans 
 and a substantial amount of gan just to ask what my 
  plans for the night are  
 i said sneak into the sleep inn for the weekend and pretend its a fivestar yeah 
 or leap into the deep end of the pool 
 i can show you where the dives are  ha 
 we dont even gotta drive far 
 i know this spot that is so live 
 but im tryna get some head first  like a nosedive  
 so many side chicks cant decide which to slide with and which should i ditch 
 so when it comes to ass bitch i get behind like the heimlich  
 had one chick who liked to flip sometimes on some switchin sides shit 
 pushed her out the sidekick then i flipped the lil white bitch off like a light switch  
 its okay not to like my shit 
 everythings fine drink your wine bitch 
 and get offline quit whinin this is just a rhyme bitch  
 but ask me will i stick to my guns  like adhesive tape  
 does bill cosby sedate once he treats to cheesecake and a decent steak  
 you think gettin rid of mes a piece of cake 
 im harder than findin harvey weinstein a date  
 and thats why they say i got more lines than black friday 
 so save that sssshit for the damn library

 pauls askin for christmas off again

 i wont stop even when my hair turns grey  
 cause they wont stop until they cancel me

 bornana 
 eating pork rinds sword fightin in pajamas 
 at the crib playin fortnite with your grandma

 thats how youll wind up like spiral stairs 
 i will swear on a stack of bibles 
 i will tear new behinds out of rivals even your idols i dont care 
 its music to be murdered by so bon iver can swallow a fuckin ja rule bobblehead 
 and die slow like alzheimers  
 lone sniper i hold a microphone like a loaded rifle 
 my domes brighter all i spit from my skulls fire

 and yall are flow biters so i dont gotta 
 explain why they call me your ghostwriter

 i said im emptyin  my book of rhymes  
 get em all off my pad every thought that i had

 i tend to get a little testy when im mad 
 but gift of gab and pen to pad turn temper tantrums into anthems 
 put lips to ass and kiss the cracks spit your damnedest 
 youre still gonna hit the canvas 
 rippin rappers veterans to whippersnappers 
 mr mathers is killin this shit villainous wit with scant less 
 syllables rip the planet biblical shits finna hit the fan

 insidious these idiots wittiest shit against me shitty as mc hammers 
 get your whole squad send a task force in 
 if you want it youre bout to get what you asked for then

 who not to start a motherfuckin rap war with 
 or to go against fuck would you wanna do that for 
 no offense but are you retards slow or dense 
 a fuckin penny has more sense 
 yeah now you gotta get killed but its not a big deal but every thought is so ill 
 and so methodical thought i swallowed a pill 
 im starting to feel like im an automobile 
 with barnacle bill inside the car at the wheel 
 inside a carnival cause im plowin into everyone who wrote snidey articles 
 and that explains why the fuck you clowns are all in my grill 
 joy and pain fortune fame torture shame choice i made 
 swore someday the world would pay less to lose more to gain daughters raised 
 yesterday glory days adored and praised ignored the hate 
 addressed the fake toured with dre tore a page from jordan came 
 destroyed the game before you came enjoy your stay 
 before its gone away but the more you claim that youre gonna point and aim 
 if it joined a gang your shit isnt going to bang 
 youre just boring lame and more of the same 
 you have an enormous chain but a stormless brain 
 the most you can form is rain 
 your shit is pointless same as a scoreless game 
 so bitch quit lyin youre denyin like mr porters name  
 borderline bipolar disorder since my stroller 
 eyes rollin back in my skull like eli porter 
 fire mortar  rounds ayatollah every iota i load up 
 i owe to my motor mouth 
 this is my note to self 
 sometimes youre gonna bomb 
 so you just might have to blow yourself up with no ones help 
 i just wrote it down in my book of rhymes 
 preemo take us out 
  
 writin in my book of rhymes

 i was chasin the bag at twentyone i was lucky 
 to find an unaten fucking  honeybun i forgot about 
 now i got money fallin out fiftis hundreds and twenties  
 and i know nothing is funny bout the manchester bombing 
 but we got something in common  both of us are alarming 
 foul disgusting and awful  so repugnant and ugly  
 i could give the boston marathon a run for its money yeah 
 and you could say im a little bit immature 
 but this type of literature got me a little richer 
 but i get insecure when them other dudes hit on you girl 
 youre letting em fiddle with your clitoris 
 remember you were my fucking 
  
 you used to be my favorite bitch 
 thingsll never be the same aint it funny how you changed 
 up and flipped the script 
 you done let a bunch of lames fall through and go plain 
 that i cant permit 
 you aint have to do it like that told you id be right back 
 look what you did i need a new chick 
 like the music i have to bounce on my favorite bitch 
  
  
 always hated my smile 
 mama told me its goofy 
 id get picked on at school 
 come home and shed school me 
 she never sugarcoated it to me 
 she said if i wasnt so stupid and ugly i wouldnt always get bullied  
 i think of my struggles  and get emotional 
 could be cause how behind the eightball and far in the hole that they put me 
 now im on a roll like a tootsie  
 im just trollin you pussies 
 but im like a stroller cause youll see just how i roll if you push me 
 but thats what i do this music for 
 when i was goin through some of the hardest times i drew from her 
 but shes like the devil cause i just cant let loose of her  
 cause the thought of losin her makes me wanna just let loose on her 
 then i hit the studio tryna rendezvous with her 
 tell her its a buttdial girl yeah booty call  
 thats how it used to be cause you and me we ruled the world 
 and we made curtis blow  
 fuck i miss them days 
  
 you used to be my favorite bitch 
 thingsll never be the same aint it funny how you changed 
 up and flipped the script 
 you done let a bunch of lames fall through and go plain 
 that i cant permit

 and your answer better be yes 
  
  
 would you marry me again 
 now that everything has changed  
 itll never be the same  
 as the era whence we came  
 from nas to pac ra  eric b and kane  
 but i know a few from this era that are lyrically insane 
 and although most are never gonna hit the level cole or weezy at 
 or be emotionally attached to yo mtv raps  
 runnin home from school to catch an episode the feeling that 
 it gave you to rip the plastic off the tape youre holdin 
 peel it back yeah tear it off and play it  
 and swear to god four oclock 
 wed crowd around the tv butter in his underwear and socks 
 when naunie was kon artis  and proof had his hair in locs  
 yeah back when flavor flav had us wearin clocks 
  back with ed lover  
 and there was two dr dres thats a paradox  
 but i never thought id get so jealous 
 at the thought of letting you go psychologically 
 its gonna bother me my eyes are already watery 
 part of me dont wanna stop  til i get you back 
 if i gotta put the work in and tell you im never givin this up 
 other part wants to tell you just to get fucked 
 go back to whatever dick that you sucked  
 get back together with them you slut 
 givin up the vagina like a trip to the gynecologist 
 when i helped you become bigger than you were 
 but i guess that it slipped your mind you must be biding your time 
 looking for someone to come along thatll make you feel like i did back when you were mine huh  
 but truthfully it was never really you and me exclusively 
 and theres too many new mcs you can choose between 
 but no matter how many motherfuckers ran through it they cant do it like me 
 but i cant keep burnin the candle at both ends 
 and i cant handle it when i leave and you find another one 
 now i gotta take this beat and dismantle it 
 i wont grieve when i kill you 
 but if i cant have you bitch nobody can 
 cant believe i used to be your favorite bitch	its time to face the music

 if youre hypersensitive i wasnt referencin the vice president chill  
 i mean my penmanship at times tends to get ill violence but with skill 
 thats why i hence when i write ends up with the mic and pencil gettin killed  
 and im still ride or die for the squad  
 so you know which side that im on 
 if a battle lines ever drawn but if i get involved 
 itll be like k9s in a brawl 
 but not similar to mike vick at all 
 cause even if i dont have a dog in the fight 
 they aint never gonna get rid of the fight in the dog  
 got stripes like a tiger so you might get mauled a mic in the palms 
 like claws i can swing right for your jaw 
 and rip it off with one swipe of the paw 
 bitch you still on my dick or nah  
 if i suck your wife is a straw  
 im sick and im not gonna cover my mouth next time that i cough cause 
  
 they say these bars are like covid  
 you get em right off the bat  
 infected with sars and corona  
 like you took a bite off of that  
 and it goes from martian to human  
 thats how the virus attacks  
 they come at me with machine guns  
 like trying to fight off a gnat  
  
  
 and da got that dope he sends to me  
 its like pneumonia symptoms and contracting covid instantly 
 which is what separates my flow from theirs 
 so that no one gets even close to this to pose a risk to me 
 so vocalistically  thats social distancing  
 flow going viral you best stay strapped 
 with that lysol and get way back  
 get that pinesol and that ajax 
 cause this dry cough is just like football umpires callin a playback 
 bitch back the fuck up like fifteen yards these rhymes call for a face mask  
 nother fourteenday quarantine theyre cordoning off everything 
 this shit lookin like a horror scene like me metaphorically  
 cause them stayathome orders seem 
 like they just keep getting more extreme 
 who knows when this nightmare will end  like monroe norma jean  
 still got that heroin lyrical drip with that morphine and that thorazine 
 cause im so fuckin dope  and youre a fiend 
 and thats the one thing that hasnt changed  
 for some semblance of normalcy 
 but i might need that hydrochloroquine cause i got that  
 the dark horse im a knightmare 
 mom fed me valium like air  
 thought thats why they called it a high chair  
 i got a contact like eyewear  
 wait a minute bitch let me lie here  
 2020 hindsight in my side mirror 
 every year you drop the ball like times square 
 my hair trigger whenever i get an ideas 
 like fuck now my name rings out like a sponge mop 
 and my drip was a drop 
 in the bucket so that gun shot 
 you just heard just now in that one spot 
 just came from the nine mil that i just got 
 thats big bucks and i got a full money clip and im loaded 
 i aint even mean to go the fuck off 
 and im still totally inappropriate with an opiate 
 groping it while im holding it like a trophy 
 im hoping a little codeinell get me odin 
 woah everything is slow i begin to floating 
 i know that im getting loaded the pen exploded 
 hiroshima with the flows a utopia 
 with the dope im an og im like the goat 
 here to get your goat little bit of sodium its assault  
 when im at the podium at your throat holy camoly 
 im in the zone with the shit im on 
 get imodium and a commode because nobodys even close 
 youre petroleum to plutonium youre a phony 
 im at the crib with your ho 
 got her at the pole like voting with no clothing 
 stripped down to a toe ring and here we go with the gloating 
 ive got my nose in the air like a boeing 
 then i got into a little bit of an argument with her 
 so i took a little lick of a klonopin at dinner 
 then i hit her with the motherfucking ottoman and bit her 
 then i shot her in the liver delivered her to the bottom of the river  
 but im probably gon jump in the water with her 
 with a wad of money cause i got a lot of it 
 and when it come to drippin i be soppin like a hundred mile an hour 
 never runnin out of either one of em i gotta get it cause 
  
 they say these bars are like covid  
 you get em right off the bat  
 infected with sars and corona  
 like you took a bite off of that  
 and it goes from martian to human  
 thats how the virus attacks  
 they come at me with machine guns  
 its like trying to fight off a gnat	yeah

 how they surround me in the stands 
 probably could drown in a sea of hands 
 theyre hollerin shady  
 yelling it out to me and thats what i mean when i say 
 that one day someway somehow if i get the chance to get a crowd 
 id flip it around and have a crowd give me the chants

 and the time it takes to do this shit 
 reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waiting roomll get 
 what i mean is maybe i have more patience  than im able to admit 
 yeah but im still mentally stable as a threelegged table in this bitch 
 fame was a switch but i was grateful to trade this shit for the trailer with a hitch 
 that it would make me a raving lunatic 
 but i made it through my situation i hit pay dirt 
 now i get paper like a stapler in this bitch 
 but just cause i made a little bit of change

 think its obvious 
 we aint never gonna seeeyeto eye 
 but itsfunny 
 as much as i hate you 
 ineed you 
 this is music to be murdered by 
  
  
 got a premonition 
 i feel the end is near 
 the beauty starts to fade 
 the joy has turned to pain 
 i hear the symphony playin 
 ten thousand violins 
 souls floating away like feathers in the wind 
  
  
 they said my last album i sounded bitter 
 no i sound like a spitter 
 who ninety percent of 
 these hypocrites are tryna get rid of 
 but why would i get a chip on my shoulder 
 i was considered one time as the illest 
 bitch im still as fly as your zipper 
 true i just get richer 
 but if it was ever all about skrilla 
 then i woulda quit a long motherfucking time ago 
 bitch shut the fuck up 
 i should go say that shit to tech n9ne or to jigga 
 nobody said shit about 2 chainz as long as hes been here shit 
 no wonder youre mad now im 
 looking at them plaques count em  
 im ll cool j bigger and deffer thats how come  
 i sell like four mil when i put out a bad album  
 revival flopped came back and i scared the crap out em 
 but rolling stone stars i get two and a half outta 
 five and ill laugh out loud 
 cause thats what they gave bad back in the day 
 which actually made me not feel as bad now cause 
 if it happened to james 
 it can happen to shady 
 they do the same shit to brady 
 more people hate me than love me 
 this game will make you go crazy 
 bout to go for broke 
 i was the g the oat 
 once i was played in rotation 
 at every radio station 
 they said im lyrically amazing 
 but i have nothing to say 
 but then when i put out revival and i had something to say 
 they said that they hated the awake me 
 i lose the rage im too tame 
 i get it back they say im too angry 
 i need to get me some dre beats 
 no i should hook up with tay keith 
 fans keep on pulling me one way 
 haters pull me in another 
 got more hooks in me than swae lee 
 bout to pick up some weights and lift til my tattoo of hailies face stretches 
 they said im just a whiner i sound like a baby 
 i dish it out but cant take it 
 but i take it dish it back out 
 and they get all bent out of shape 
 this shits almost comical 
 wait and i meant no disrespect 
 i wasnt dissin tech that was not a shot at 2 chainz or to jayz 
 they probably feel the same way because lately 
 instead of us being credited for longevity 
 and being able to keep it up for this long at this level we 
 get told well never be what we were 
 bitch if i was as half as good as i was 
 im still twice as good as youll ever be 
 only way that youre ahead of mes alphabetically 
 cause if you diss me im coming after you like the letter v 
 killing everything play this tune its your eulogy 
 its your funeral prepare to die 
 this is music for you to be murdered by	oh this what we doin alright 
 ma

 pro professional pure persistent im paper chasing 
 i hate complaining i hated waiting ill pay for patience 
 but i hate to pay a bill  
 and i made a mil without a major deal

 money aint a thing that aint a thing for real 
 its the broke lingo  
 and no aint nothing saweetie this is no quavo

 neck wet big drip im in rain mode  
 eight niggas eight hittas take eight souls  
 collect pesos  and im paid so  
 selfmade goals  
 when the pain leaves  
 where does the pain go  
 tip of the backwood is where the flame goes  
 to the sky is where my brain goes  
 same pack same fiend sellin the same clothes  
 pinocchio and my pistol they got the same nose 
 me and my niggas gotta eat we share the same stove  
 case closed bodies in my lane bitch lane closed 
  
 game over thanos on you hos 
 on my petty shit but i dont paint toes  
 get the plunger  cause marshall and ma go plum crazy 
 call us liquid plumber cause even dre know  
 beat knocks like a beefed up detox 
 youre gonna need three squads of police officers at least to come pull me off of it and i dont stop 
 please dawg i need yall to keep talking shit cause i feed off of it 
 i am the complete opposite of these retards who spit these weak bars ima leave carnage 
 each thoughtll be so toxic itll block the wind through your esophagus 
 stop it cutting off your oxygen 
 and i hit them pads like a boxing gym 
 better watch for slim better get to popping and when im at the top again 
 i wont topple im giving it to anyone who wanna come and get it and im not gonna stop 
 but when they ask me is the war finished with mgk of course it is 
 i cleansed him of his mortal sins im god and the lord forgives even the devil worshippers 
 im moving on but you know your scruples are gone when youre born with lucifers horns 
 and youre from the school of notorious puba cube and the poor righteous teachers tutored my students 
 showed them all the blueprint and formula 
 but it seems like the more they studied my music the more they remind me of eyeballs 
 im watching my pupils get cornier  
 but im contemplating yelling bombs away on the game 
 like im outside of an ariana grande concert waiting 
  
  
 they call me saddam hussein ayatollah khomeini 
 wheres osama been i been laden lately

 as a child picked on clowned been 
 countless times ive been doubted 
 gotta remind myself of it every now and then  
 so the route i wents selfempowerment 
 in a hole taught myself how to get out of it 
 and balance it with talents wit 
 cause life is like a penny  
 cause its only one percent 
 who overcome the shit theyve underwent 
 i went awol like what my back was up against 
 dont tell me bout struggle bitch i lived it 
 i was five or six the first time i got my hind end kicked 
 malcolm isaac and boogie jumped me and took my tricycle 
 and i dont know if i would call that white privilege yeah 
 but i get it how it feels to be judged by pigment 
 besides getting it from both sides of the tracks 
 but i swore id get them back 
 even if it meant selling my soul to get my revenge and  
 thought of a scheme and it got me to thinking 
 if i can believe in myself i could prolly achieve it 
 thats part of the reason i do all my talking with ink 
 and as long as im breathing i vow to outsmart em and beat em 
 my god what a heart of a demon go at em and ima get even

 if denaun and me find a couple dimes a piece 
 twenty five cents eachd get us a bag of chips 
 wed be glad to get that even if we had to split 
 wed do backward flips looking back at it 
 i think that would fit with the definition of not having shit 
 couple that with the fact my mother was batshit 
 pop was a sack of shit yeah he died but i gave half a shit 
 yeah which brings me back to the dear ol dad that i zero had 
 since a yearold fortyseven yearold scab

 had your coffin draped with a heros flag 
 where the fuck you were at 
 when deangelo done hurt me real bad at the rio grande 
 never met your grandkids fucking coward 
 only guts you had was from your stomach fat 
 i couldnt see your ass goin to heaven 
 so im asking for a pass to go to hell 
 so i can whip your fucking ass 
 i hate that ill never get to say i hate you to your face 
 no coming back from where im going 
 sky is dark my soul is black hand on the shovel 
 dig with the blade of it then i step on the metal 
 vendetta to settle tell the devil

 youre so hard to resist you knock my socks off 
 my friends say youre bad for me hogwash 
  
  
 ill never love again 
 the way i loved you

 you know my love for you was undying yeah 
 used to always have my back 
  
  
 some days it feels like youre all that i have 
 thats why im tryna hold onto you for as long as i can 
 and you just want me for my money so i got you wrapped all in saran 
 damn talk about eatin out the palm of my hand 
 but if not for my financials 
 i wouldnt have you anyways there have been ample 
 plenty days where im just in a daze and i cant pull 
 myself up out this rut and youre so much of a handful 
 i can only take so much of you all at one time 
 because too much of yous just too much to swallow sometimes 
 gotta take you in doses but when youre not at my side 
 i shake in convulsions separation anxiety cause we may be the closest 
 yeah baby we hopeless dont we make an atrocious 
 combination we know its like playin with explosives 
 quite dangerous though but my brains in hypnosis 
 such a wide range of emotions 
 migraines but why the fuck am i takin these motrins 
 ibuprofens like a drop of rain in the ocean 
 and youre my fix on the days when im broken 
 but the shits about to go sideways i just know it

 youre my habit its like i found you in the cabinet 
 but its like i cant uncap it cause its childproof 
 a scoundrel and fiends how i feel around you 
 awful every time i lost you felt like i had you in my pocket 
 now im flippin over the furniture punchin holes in the walls through 
 everything that weve gone through

 now im flippin over the furniture punchin holes in the walls through 
 everything that weve gone through

 they talk about my daughters hopin i fly off of the handle  
 cause my first thought is to trample and write a thousand bars 
 but sometimes its like dropping an anvil on a house of cards 
 or godzilla squashin a crouton with combat boots on 
 or droppin a goddamn nuke bomb on top of an anthill 
  cant do it nah

 my pencil full of poisonous lead the devil 
 he wants me to murder this beat so i will 
 he told me there are doubters who question my skill 
 they wanna put my style to the test am i still 
 the best they want the crown on my head i said chill 
 if you want me to murder this beat then i will 
  
  
 im a long way away from where you are in skill 
 foreign wheels my bitch wearin fourinch heels 
 she on the orange pill 
 and she about to start taking off layers like orange peels 
 sacha baron cohen ferrell where am i going with this

 im lyrically james todd tariq trotter minus the cap 
  
 i thought i heard a voice in my head that said kill 
 i had no other choice that was left except fill 
 my pencil full of poisonous lead the devil 
 he wants me to murder this beat so i will 
 he told me there are doubters who question my skill

 manslaughter goons under the moonlight 
 john wilkes thats who im in the booth like 
 ayy bruh i go ham for dead presidents 
 and everything i record is over your head like a boom mic 
 why would you irrelevant fucks want to rebel against us 
 knowing your smith  wesson has never been clutched 
 knowing you never been rushed by the most ignorant niggas invented 
 them niggas thatll send you to the dentist to get a whole row of elephant tusks 
 your teeth gone like you been on some meth and some dust forever 
 i see you my niggas call me the enemy watcher 
 the minute we spot ya the semill pop nigga we got ya 
 im livin to conquer remember the mantra im grippin the launcher 
 like em and the doctor with no guilty conscience 
 im still shockin like droppin a boombox in bathwater 
 more shockin than a pissed off blanka 
  
 i just finished fuckin a fish called wanda 
 im finna wander off into yonder 
 beyond just mentally stronger memory monster 
 i remember the sponsorin thought that conquered his triple entendre 
 you the cross of a unicorn and the unabomber 
 quit horsin around in this building or you a goner 
 your willy wonka persona wont help you any longer 
 im optimus i make prime examples of mini tonkas 
 hogtie your squad and go bonkers 
 spin grab denauns guitar and honky tonk ya 
 all your bars subpar like good golfers 
 i put a hole in one of you birdies with this eagle and launch it  
  
  
 i thought i heard a voice in my head that said kill 
 i had no other choice that was left except fill 
 my pencil full of poisonous lead the devil 
 he wants me to murder this beat so i will 
 he told me there are doubters who question my skill 
 they wanna put my style to the test am i still 
 the best they want the crown on my head i said chill 
 if you want me to murder this beat then i will 
  
  
 now this will probably be the most illest shit that ive ever said 
 god bless the dead and let biggie possess the pencil lead 
 they called me a sped and said that i had a messed up head 
 cause i said motherfuck school and instead went to special ed 
 sippin bacardi and lime i start to recollect on the time 
 that i startled my mom and had her scared to death 
 word to method man 
 she heard some wutang coming from towards the patio 
 she was like what the heck was that 
 she went to check on the noise and go inspect the deck 
 then i jumped out with a sword and yelled protect your neck 
 now bow to the lord hold up no better yet kneel 
 better yet get down on all fours and take a vow to always 
 rejoice in the sound of my voice but you dont have a choice 
 just a third of my will will overpower yours 
 using about a fourth to create the amount of force 
 itll take to knock out a horse like a tranq full of tylenol 
 enter my house of horrors with a thousand floors 
 got a crown of thorns but it wont fit around the horns 
 but ima keep it a buck like a dollar store 
 im more than you bargained for and i am far more worse 
 than a fortysome bar lord jamar verse 
 nothing means more than respect so when i curse 
 you could say i swore to protect 
 my image i have zero time or regard for 
 a neverwas been claiming rap when its not yours 
 if it was anyones house g rap and rakim would be havin you mop floors 
 rundmc would be havin you cleanin sinks 
 yeah your group was off the chain but you were the weakest link 
 rest of these youngins of mine 
 time to start throwing some shade this time im shutting the blinds 
 cause when im looking at yall shit its no wonder its why 
 i need a visor cause yall are just sons in my eyes 
 born a cynic and more demented than an orphanage with a morgue up in it 
 next door to an abortion clinic 
 newborn infants tortured and tormented 
 with their foreheads dented when they drop cause the floors cemented 
 their corpses get ornamented 
 the coroner with a storage bin rented 
 to store them in and the torsos of forty women reported missin 
 distorted twisted this isnt no storybook ending 
 this is only the beginning 
 so lord forgive me im hearing voices 
 i cant ignore them anymore theyre winning 
  
 i thought i heard a voice in my head that said kill 
 i had no other choice that was left except fill 
 my pencil full of poisonous lead the devil 
 he wants me to murder this beat so i will

 and stapled his nuts to a stack of paper  
 walked in the strip club had my jacket zipped up

 way before my baby daughter hailie 
 i was harassed daily by this fat kid named deangelo bailey 
 an eighth grader who acted obnoxious cause his father boxes 
 so every day hed shove me in the lockers 
 one day he came in the bathroom while i was pissin 
 and had me in the position to beat me into submission 
 he banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose 
 soaked my clothes in blood grabbed me and choked my throat 
 i tried to plead and tell him we shouldnt beef 
 but he just wouldnt leave 
 he kept chokin me and i couldnt breathe 
 he looked at me and said you gonna die honky 
 the principal walked in and started helpin him stomp me 
  
 i made em think they beat me to death 
 holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left 
 then i got up and ran to the janitors storage booth 
 kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the fourinch screws 
 grabbed some sharp objects brooms and foreign tools 
 this is for every time you took my orange juice 
 or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk 
 every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt 
 im gettin you back bully now once and for good 
 i cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as i could 
 and beat him over the head with it til i broke the wood 
 knocked him down stood on his chest with one foot 
 made it home later that same day 
 started readin a comic and suddenly everything became gray 
 i couldnt even see what i was tryin to read 
 i went deaf and my left ear started to bleed 
 my mother started screamin what are you on drugs 
 look at you youre gettin blood all over my rug  
 she beat me over the head with the remote control 
 opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull 
 i picked it up and screamed look bitch what have you done 
 oh my god im sorry son 
 shut up you cunt 
 i said fuck it took it and stuck it back up in my head 
 then i sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck

 what are friends 
 friends are people that you think are your friends 
 but they really your enemies with secret identities 
 and disguises to hide they true colors 
 so just when you think you close enough to be brothers 
 they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin

 to all the happy people 
 all the happy people who have real nice lives 
 and have no idea what its like to be broke as fuck 
  
  
 i feel like im walkin a tight rope without a circus net 
 poppin percocet im a nervous wreck 
 i deserve respect but i work a sweat for this worthless check 
 im bout to burst this tec at somebody to reverse this debt 
 minimum wage got my adrenaline caged 
 full of venom and rage specially when im engaged 
 and my daughters down to her last diaper its got my ass hyper 
 i pray that god answers maybe ill ask nicer 
 watchin ballers while they flossin in they pathfinders 
 these overnight stars becomin autographsigners 
 we all long to blow up and leave the past behind us 
 along with the small fries and average halfpinters 
 but playerhaters turnin bitch like they have vaginas 
 cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us 
 moneyll brainwash you and leave yo ass mindless 
 them snakes slither in the grass spineless 
  
 thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill 
 thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal 
 thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here 
 cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear 
 thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill 
 thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal 
 thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here 
 cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear 
  
  
 my life is full of empty promises and broken dreams 
 im hopin things look up but there aint no job openings 
 i feel discouraged hungry and malnourished 
 livin in this house with no furnace unfurnished 
 and im sick of workin deadend jobs with lame pay 
 and im tired of bein hired and fired the same day 
 but fuck it if you know the rules to the game play 
 cause when we die we know we all goin the same way 
 cause its cool to be the player but it sucks to be the fan 
 when all you need is bucks to be the man plus a luxury sedan 
 or comfortable and roomy in a 6 
 but they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics 
 who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day 
 and yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today 
 my daughter wants to throw the ball but im too stressed to play 
 live half my life and throw the rest away 
  
 thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill 
 thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal 
 thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here 
 cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear 
 thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill 
 thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal 
 thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here 
 cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear 
  
  
 theres people that love me and people that hate me  
 but its the evil that made me 
 this backstabbin deceitful and shady  
 i want the money the women the fortune and fame 
 that means i end up burnin in hell scorchin in flame 
 that means im stealin your checkbook and forgin your name 
 this lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain 
 cause right now i feel like ive just hit the rock bottom 
 ive got problems now everybody on my blocks got em  
 im screamin like them two cops when 2pac shot em 
 holdin two glocks hope your doors got new locks on em 
 my daughters feet aint got no shoes or socks on em 
 and them rings you wearin look like they got a few rocks on em 
 and while you flaunt em 
 i could be takin em to shops to pawn em 
 i got a couple of rings and a brandnew watch you want em 
 cause i aint never went gold off one song 
 im runnin up on someones lawn with guns drawn 
  
 thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill 
 thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal 
 thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here 
 cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear 
 thats rock bottom when this life makes you mad enough to kill 
 thats rock bottom when you want somethin bad enough to steal 
 thats rock bottom when you feel like youve had it up to here 
 cause you mad enough to scream but you sad enough to tear

 and thats my name	i reckon you aint familiar with these here parts 
 you know theres a story behind that there saloon 
 20 years ago two outlaws took this whole town over 
 sheriffs couldnt stop em 
 quickest damn gunslingers ive ever seen 
 got murdered in coldblood 
 that old saloon there was their little home away from home 
 they say the ghosts of bad and evil still live in that tavern 
 and on a quiet night you can still hear 
 the footsteps of slim shady and royce da 59 
  
  
 i dont speak i float in the air wrapped in a sheet 
 im not a real person im a ghost trapped in a beat 
 i translate when my voice is read through a seismograph 
 and the noise is spread 
 picked up and transmitted through royces head  
 trap him in his room possess him and hoist his bed 
 til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead 
 told him each one of his boys is dead  
 i asked him to come to the dark side 
 he made a choice and said  
 who hard yo i done heard worse 
 we can get in two cars and accelerate at each other 
 to see which onell swerve first 
 two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity 
 holds that of a globe on top of nine other planets 
 kissed the cheek of the devil intelligence level 
 is hellier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto 
 dismissal im not a fair man disgraced the race of an atheist 
 interceptin missiles with my bare hands like a patriot 
 one track sliced without swords i buried the christ corpse 
 in my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse 
 and stay overworked its like the nazis and the nation 
 collaboratin attemptin to take over the earth 
  
 cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
 we hit the trees til we look like vietnamese people 
 hes evil and im bad like steve seagal 
 above the law cause i dont agree with police either 
 shit me neither 
  
  
 we aint eager to be legal 
 so please leave me with the keys to your jeep eagle 
 i breathe ether in three lethal amounts 
 while i stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle  
 releasin rage on anybody in squeezin range 
 cold enough to make the seasons change into freezin rain 
  no im not i just want to shoot up 
 and im pissed off cause i cant find a decent vein 
 the disaster with dreads im bad enough to commit suicide 
 and survive long enough to kill my soul after im dead 
 when in danger its funny actually my flavors similar to a waiter 
 cause i serve any stranger with money 
 i spray a hundred man until they joint chains 
 while slippin bullets at pointblank range like they was punches 
 piss on a flag and burn it murder you then come to your funeral 
 service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it 
 whippin human ass throwin blows crackin jaws 
 with my fists wrapped in gauze dipped in glue and glass 
 im blazin emcees at the same time amazin emcees 
 somehow emcees aint that eyebrowraisin to me 
 from all of angles of us flash a mac loud enough 
 to cast a avalanche and bust til volcanoes erupt 
  
 hello  
 ayo whats up  
 stop they know its us 
  
  
 i used to be a loudmouth remember me  
 im the one who burned your house down  
 well im out now  
 and this time im comin back to blow your house up 
 and i aint gon leave you with a window to jump out of 
 give me two fat tabs and three shrooms 
 and you wont see me like fat people in steam rooms 
 and when i go to hell and im gettin ready to leave 
 ima put air in a bag and charge people to breathe 
  
  
 cause this is what happens when bad meets evil 
 and we hit the trees til we look like vietnamese people 
 hes evil and im bad like steve seagal 
 against peaceful see you in hell for the sequel 
  see you in hell

 bad meets evil what  
  
 and so thats the story of when bad meets evil 
 two of the most wanted individuals in the county 
 made jesse james and billy the kid look like lawabiding citizens 
 its too bad they had to go out the way they did 
 got shot in the back comin out of that old saloon 
 but their spirits still live on til this day

 and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments 
 i grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth 
 with a fucked up childhood that i used as an excuse 
 and aint shit changed i kept the same mind state

 im polishin gold waitin for this drama to unfold 
 i got a blunt rolled 
 feelin bold gangstas blood runs cold 
 its time to reload this old 45 colt 
 the winds gusty its hot muggy and dusty 
 bust a couple shots make sure im not rusty 
 its past noon he should be here soon 
 sip a little moonshine inside a saloon 
 all of a sudden i can hear the sound of hoofs 
 sounds like a thousand wolves 
 i cock back put the toast in the holster and froze 
 i pose like a poster hes closer than close 
 i hold the heat sturdy i heard he fights dirty 
 but ima put 30 inside him and leave early 
 and just when i went to fill him with hot lead 
 i put the gun to his head and this is what he said 
 you never met me youll probably never see me again 
 but i know you the names slim you want revenge 
 then dont shoot im in the same boots as you 
 im telling the truth i got a price on my head too 
 cause when you

 and life aint fun when youre on the run 
 got your gold and you got your gun 
 but life as an outlaw just begun 
 got your shotgun by your side

 he said take ten paces shit i took eight 
 spun around and i aimed straight for the brain 
 my shit went bang but it only fired a blank he said 
 you need bullets hurry up run 
 i put a clip in the gun and pointed at his lungs 
 we both drew at the same time and stood stunned 
 go ahead shoot me but im not the one you want 
 i figured he was tellin the truth thats why i didnt shoot 
 so what we gon do its on you

 and he already sold two 
 loaded up my saddle got ready for battle 
 hid two pieces of gold inside of my satchel 
 we rolled two miles until we hit the spot 
 an old ghost town that everybody forgot 
 a place where they used to smoke chronic a lot 
 slim grabbed the shotgun 
 dre heres the plot 
 this is the spot they call him doc loveless 
 hes going around saying he took the game from us 
 lets shoot him in his kneecaps hell never see it comin 
 he aint got no legs they cut them off at the stomach 
 hes got mechanical legs he spins webs 
 plus hes wellrespected by the hiphop heads 
 our mission is to get him to stop layin eggs 
 and we can put him on his back down a flight of steps 
 i drew two guns spun them on my fingers 
 kicked the swingin doors in started gunslingin 
 i could hear somebody singin it sounded like a g thang 
 and a verse from keep their heads ringin 
 i said its dres day and started to spray 
 its 1800 he pulls a ak 
 hollow tips started flyin every which way 
 thats when i seen dre in trouble and came with the gauge 
 i fired the first shot spun his body around 
 he hit the ground and landed upside down 
 dre grabbed the map the plaques and the gold 
 i grabbed two girlies and a blunt thats rolled

 get this fuckin audio out my audi yo adis 
 i can see why people like lil yachty but not me though 
 not even dissin it just aint for me 
 all i am simply is just an emcee 
 maybe stan just isnt your cup of tea  
 maybe your cups full of syrup and lean 
 maybe i need to stir up shit preferably 
 shake the world up if it were up to me 
 paul wants me to chill yall want me to ill 
 i should eat a pill probably i will 
 old me killed the new me watch him bleed to death 
 i breathe on the mirror i dont see my breath 
 possibly im dead i must be possessed 
 like an evil spell im evil  
 jam a crest whitestrip in the tip of my dick 
 with an ice pick stick it in a vise grip 
 hang it on a spike fence bang it with a pipe wrench 
 while i take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch 
 like vice president mike pence 
 back up on my shit in a sidekick as i lay it on a spike strip 
 these are things that id rather do than hear you on a mic 
 since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and 
 jesus christ man how many times is 
 someone gonna fuck on my bitch  
 you wont ever see em icy 
 but as cold as i get on the mic 
 i polarize shit so the thames might freeze 
 and your skull might split like i bashed you upside it 
 bitch i got the club on smash like a nightstick  
 turn down for what 
 i aint loud enough nah turn the valium up

 i spit at ill bet a hundred thousand bucks 
 youll turn around and just be like man how the fuck 
 sourpuss gonna get mad just cause his album sucks 
 and now he wants to take it out on us  
 but last week an exfan mailed me a copy 
 of the mathers lp to tell me to study 
 itll help me get back to myself and shell love me  
 i mailed the bitch back and said if i did that 
 id just be like everyone else in the fucking industry 
 especially an effing recovery clone of me  
 so fingerbang chicken wang mgk igg azae 
 lil pump lil xan imitate lil wayne 
 i should aim at everybody in the game pick a name 
 im fed up with bein humble 
 and rumor is im hungry im sure you heard rumblings 
 i heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach 
 i heard your mumblin but its jumbled in mumbojumbo 
 the era that im from will pummel you thats what its comin to 
 what the fuck youre gonna do when you run into it 
 im gonna crumble you and ill take a number two 
 and dump on you if you aint joyner 
 if you aint kendrick or cole or sean then youre a goner 
 im bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it 
 i guess when you walk into bk you expect a whopper 
 you can order a quarter pounder when you go to mcdonalds 
 but if youre lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get revival 
 but yall are actin like i tried to serve you up a slider 
 maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned 
 and you woulda bought it 
 but sayin i no longer got it 
 cause you missed a line and never caught it 
 cause it went over your head because youre too stupid to get it 
 cause youre mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest 
 with your expertise and knowledge but youll never be an artist 
 and im harder on myself than you could ever be regardless 
 what ill never be is flawless all ill ever be is honest  
 even when im gone theyre gonna say i brought it 
 even when i hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic 
 with a bottle full of malt liquor 
 but i couldnt bottle this shit any longer 
 the fact that i know that ima hit my bottom 
 if i dont pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet 
 i dont see why yall even started with me 
 i get in beefs my enemies die 
 i dont cease fire til at least all are deceased 
 im east side never be caught slippin 
 now you see why i dont sleep not even a wink i dont blink 
 i dont doze off i dont even nod to the beats 
 i dont even close my fuckin eyes when i sneeze 
 aw man that bet cypher was weak it was garbage 
 the thing aint even orangeoh my god thats a reach 
 shout to all my colorblind people 
 each and everyone of yall if you call a fire engine green 
 aquamarine or you think water is pink 
 dawg thats a date  looks like an olive to me 
 look theres an apple  no its not its a peach 
 so fingerbang pootie tang 
 burger king gucci gang dookie dang 
 charlamagne gonna hate anyway doesnt matter what i say 
 give me donkey of the day 
 what a way for 2018 to get underway 
 but im gonna say everything that i wanna say 
 welcome to the slaughterhouse bitch  
 invite em in like a one a day 
 im not done  
 cause i feel like the beast of burden 
 that line in the sand was it even worth it 
 cause the way i see people turnings 
 makin it seem worthless its startin to defeat the purpose 
 im watchin my fan base shrink to thirds 
 and i was just tryin to do the right thing but word 
 has the court of public opinion reached a verdict 
 or still yet to be determined 
 cause im determined to be me critiqued or worshipped 
 but if i could go back id at least reword it 
 and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent 
 sold the dream to that hes deserted 
 but i think its workin 
 these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous 
 and hes too scurred to answer me with words 
 cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered 
 but i know at least hes heard it 
 cause agent orange just sent the secret service 
 to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him 
 or ask if im linked to terrorists 
 i said only when it comes to ink and lyricists 
 but my beef is more media journalists 
  
 i said my beef is more meaty a journalist 
 can get a mouthful of flesh 
 and yes i mean eating a penis 
 cause theyve been pannin my album to death 
 so ive been givin the media fingers 
 dont wanna turn this to a counseling sesh 
 but theyve been puttin me through the ringer 
 so i aint ironin shit out with the press 
 but i just took this beat to the cleaners	motherfuckers talkin crazy  
 sayin i should quit  
 i fuckin tell em make me  
 eat a fuckin dick  
 im feelin like the greatest  
 on the beat who ever did it 
 mike will the one who made it 
 its shady on the lyrics 
  
  
 im somewhat outlandish they say

 bar for me when i rap isnt fair but

 you in the wrong cab down the wrong path 
 nigga wrong way wrong road  
 snakes in the grass tryna slither fast 
 i just bought a fuckin lawn mower

 fuck you think  
  
  
 i got a couple of mansions 
 still i dont have any manners 
 you got a couple of ghostwriters 
 but to these kids it dont actually matter 
 theyre askin me what the fuck happened to hiphop 
 i said i dont have any answers 
 cause i took an l when i dropped my last album 
 it hurt me like hell but im back on these rappers 
 and actually comin from humble beginnings 
 im somewhat uncomfortable winning 
 i wish i could say what a wonderful feeling 
 were on the upswing like were punchin the ceiling 
 but nothin is feeling like anyone has any fuckin ability 
 to even stick to a subject its killin me 
 the inability to pen humility 
 hatata batata why dont we make a bunch of 
 fuckin songs about nothin and mumble em 
 fuck it im goin for the jugular 
 shit is a circus you clowns that are comin up 
 dont give an ounce of a motherfuck 
 about the ones that were here before you that made rap 
 lets recap way back mcs that wreak havoc on tape decks 
 adats where the g raps and kanes at 
 we need 3 stacks asap and bring masta ace back 
 cause half of these rappers have brain damage 
 all the lean rappin face tats syruped out like tree sap 
 i dont hate trap and i dont wanna seem mad 
 but in fact where the old me at the same cat 
 that would take that feedback and aim back i need that 
 but i think its inevitable 
 they know what button to press or what lever to pull 
 to get me to snap though  
 and if i pay it attention im probly makin it bigger 
 but youve been takin ya dicks in the fuckin back ho  
 on the brink any minute got me thinkin of finishin 
 everything with acetaminophen and reapin the benefits 
 im asleep at the wheel again 
 as i peak into thinkin about an evil intent 
 of another beat ima kill again 
 cause even if i gotta end up eatin a pill again 
 even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin 
 it better be at least 70 or 300 milligram 
 and i might as well cause ima end up bein a villain again 
 levels to this shit i got an elevator 
 you could never say to me im not a fuckin record breaker 
 i sound like a broken record every time i break a record 
 nobody could ever take away the legacy i made i never cater 
 motherfucker now i got a right to be this way 
 i got spite inside my dna 
 but i roll til the wheels fall off im workin tirelessly ayy 
 its the moment yall been waitin for 
 like california wishin rain to pour 
 in that drought yall been prayin for 
 my downfall from the 8 mile to the southpaw 
 still the same marshall that outlaw 
 that they say as a writer mightve fell off 
 im back on that bull like the cowboy 
  
 so yall gotta move  yall gotta move  yall gotta move 
 give me some room give me some room give me the juice 
 hop out the coupe hop out the coupe hop out and shoot 
 yall gotta move yall gotta move give me the juice	hey em its paul umm i listened to the new album umm are you really gonna just reply to everybody who you dont like what they have to say uh about you or the stuff youre working on i mean i dont know if thats really a great idea itsits like whats next kamikaze 2 the album where you reply to everybody who didnt like the album that you made replying to everybody that didnt like the previous album its a slippery slope ii dont know if its a really good idea umm anyway hit me back	yo how do i keep 
  
 gettin in relationships like this 
  
 maybe it says somethin about me 
  
 should i look in the mirror 
  
  
 i just want you to be normal 
 why cant you bitches be normal 
 always gotta be so extra 
 why you always need a lecture 
 my ex hates to talk shes a texter 
 even when im in bed layin right next to her 
 wants to get back together 
 said not til she gets her act together 
  
  
 she thinks im bein mean and now 
 she starts to scream and shout 
 shes about to let the demons out 
 she dont wanna see me with other females out 
 i tell the bitch to beat it take the scenic route 
 she retaliates by tryin to leave the house 
 in an evening gown with her cleavage out 
 weve been down this road too many times for me to count 
 and all i can think is how 
  
 i just want you to be normal 
 why cant you bitches be normal 
 always gotta be so extra 
 like a fuckin terrestrial 
 i guess it comes with the territory 
 my ex girl she just declared war 
 therefore i better prepare for it 
 i guess bein weirds normal 
  
  
 and i dont know whats got a hold of me 
 most notably ive been zonin to jodeci 
 im totally open hopelessly devoted 
 so much so that i bet you she dont even know that shes 
 the first thing i think of when i wake up 
 and the last thing i think of fore i go to sleep 
 sike hope she dont notice me goin through her purse 
 i know she cheats so do i im soulless shes heartless 
 no wonder were partners 
 both got hundreds of charges 
 domestic disputes but weve always 
 swept it under the carpet 
 even when 911 gets the call that 
 i slipped up and busted her jaw with 
 a louisville slugger cause alls it 
 really does is make our love 
 for each other grow stronger 
 she won me over the second she tried to run me over 
 told her id keep it a hun we over 
 kicked her out called her back now shes coming over 
 but why is she so wicked 
 and how the fuck did i get so twisted 
 up with someone so unlikable and shifty 
 were like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with 
 ignitable liquids but im finally seeing 
 shes only mine for the time being 
 thats why i keep bringin up that one time she 
 tried to twotime me 
 and throw it up in her face til i dry heave 
 how could i be so naive 
 should i leave or turn this entire evening 
 into a motherfucking crime scene 
 maybe im just too ugly to compete with him 
 you werent sposed to agree you fucking bitch 
 specially when youre the one cheated first 
 now the argument immediately becomes heated 
 you dont want me to flip little conceited cunt 
 eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita 
 slut treat it just like a drum beat it 
 complete it and once youve succeeded repeat it 
  
 i love you but i hope you fuckin die though 
 in our business your friends like to pry so 
 youve got em all under cover just like moles 
 hopin theyll come back with intel 
 but im the one whos thrown into the spiral 
 cause now the roles are reversed so here i go 
 thinkin im sly as i scroll through your iphone 
 who the fucks milo 
 the guy at work who drives a hilo 
 i put a tracking device on your chrysler 
 and follow you while you drive home 
 but like a cyclone i just got my disguise blown 
 you recognize me and had milo flip me off 
 right out the passenger side window  
 i hit a light pole you skirt off 
 and then pull up at 5 am in the drive in a stretched white limo 
 stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with milos demo 
 but like a drunk bum what do i know 
 lets sleep on it like they did revival 
 i told you youre the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole 
  
  
 just wanna be normal 
 why cant you be normal  
 i just wanna be normal 
 why cant you be normal	paul yo um 
 so i got your message i wish you would answer the fuckin phone 
 um 
  
 no i dont plan to reply to everybody who fuckin says something fucked up about me 
 but i will say this i was reading some comments last night about like  what people are fuckin saying about revival 
 and uhh 
 yo this yahoo motherfucker whatever the fuck his name is said i rhyliterally said i rhymed rhymes with chimes 
 sucker free confidence high 
 such a breeze when i pen rhymes 
  
 like you dont understand im rhyming the entire fuckin sentence you fuckin moron 
  
 its my fault cause youre fuckin stupid 
 but i swear to god this motherfucker lives in michigan and i think i figured out his address 
 and im on my way to his fuckin house right now 
  
 ill hit you back later	take me to the river 
 yeah yeah yeah yeah 
  
  
 its 2002 everything was totally new 
 we were globally huge watchin sales go through the roof 
 we wrote and we feuded runyon avenue soldiers included 
 a multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse 
 we were so bulletproofwrote souped and soaked in our youth 
 thought we was runnin shit til we lost the sole of our shoe 
 the death of doody broke us in two 
 we were thrown for a loop aint none of us know what to do 
 and at the time i was goin through my own struggles too 
 so i wasnt in no condition to be coachin us through 
 everyone tried to go solo really nobody blew 
 i was hopin they do so i aint have to shoulder the crew 
 the plan was put everyone in position so that they knew 
 how to stand on their own and i dont wanna open up wounds 
 i just noticed that oomph was gone when we go in the booth 
 cause the truth is the moment that proof died so did the group 
 shoot 
  
  
 if i could leave this all behind 
 i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line 
 down to the river with you 
 help me leave this all behind 
  
 ima wash away my sins 
 ima rinse away this dirt 
 i forgot to make amends 
 to all the friends i may have hurt 
 i better stop and say my grace 
 from it i pray that i dont fall 
 cause on the way back down i may 
 end up runnin back into them all 
 i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones 
  
  
 it was never the same and its bothered me since 
 and the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets 
 the more time goes by the more life happens 
 and we gotta be men we got responsibilities 
 plus we dont say how we feel 
 and i feel like this is what got us in the debacle were in 
 been with you guys thick and thin 
 but its almost as if sometimes were not even friends 
 which reminded me biz rockstar was the shit 
 yall coulda got you a hit without me on the shit 
 if you woulda put d12 on it wish i coulda did 
 more than try talkin you into comin up off of it 
 i know it wasnt my fault but part of it probably is 
 i think of all of the trips to bet 
 and the rappers i wish that we woulda politicked with 
 maybe yall coulda clicked and got you some features 
 but thats water under the bridge 
 but im washin my sins in it til my conscience is cleansed 
  
 if i could leave this all behind 
 i could open up my eyes and walk in a straight line 
 down to the river with you 
 help me leave this all behind 
  
  
 ima wash away my sins 
 ima rinse away this dirt 
 i forgot to make amends 
 to all the friends i may have hurt 
 i better stop and say my grace 
 from it i pray that i dont fall 
 cause on the way back down i may 
 end up runnin back into them all 
 i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones 
  
  
 bacardi and hen never thought the party would end 
 one minute youre bodyin shit but then your audience splits 
 you can already sense the climate is startin to shift 
 to these kids you no longer exist 
 went from rainin cats and dogs in this bitch 
 to tiny drops little drips 
 and by the time your reign is over youll hardly be missed 
 you start thinkin of all the artists you dissed 
 all the carnage you left is this the kind of karma you get 
 for turnin your fuckin back on bizzy kuniva and swift 
 a freudian slip subconsciously i honestly wished 
 i aint feel so much guilt and yall didnt harbor resentment 
 but its hard to pretend that yall aint got none 
 i just wish i had words but i guess there just are none for this 
 to my partners i cant say how sorry i am 
 this is not how i planned for our story to end 
 i love all of you men 
 but i just cant be the guy everybody depends 
 on for entire careers cause thats not even fair 
 i will always be here but that spark isnt there 
 and i dont know how to recapture that time and that era 
 ive tried hearkening back to but im fightin for air 
 im barely chartin myself 
 feels like im on the descent but it was not my intent 
 to treat yall like a stepping stone 
 though i aint left no one behind but we been down every road 
 done all we possibly can i know we kept our hopes up 
 but the longer we spend livin this lie that we live 
 the less is left for closure so lets let this go 
 its not goodbye to our friendship but d12 is over 
  
 ima wash away my sins 
 ima rinse away this dirt 
 i forgot to make amends 
 to all the friends i may have hurt 
 i better stop and say my grace 
 from it i pray that i dont fall 
 cause on the way back down i may 
 end up runnin back into them all 
 i never meant to use you all as my stepping stones 
  
  
 i never meant to make you feel like my stepping stones 
 i never meant to use you all for my stepping stones	tay keith fuck these niggas up

 detractors i might have to fuck pitchfork with a corkscrew

 revenge is the best medicine  
 increase the dose from least to most 
 and then tell the grammys to go and fuck themselves 
 they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches 
 so they nominate em get em there get a name to mc the show 
 every parasite needs a host  
 then give album of the year to somebody that no ones ever even heard of 
 all i know is i wrote every single word to everything i ever murdered 
 time to separate the sheep from goats  
 and i got no faith in your writers i dont believe in ghosts 
 when rap needed it most i was that wing and a prayer  
 a beacon of hope put a bird in the air 
 somewhere some kid is bumpin this while he lipsyncs in the mirror 
 thats who im doin it for the rest i dont really even care 
 but you would think im carryin an oxford dictionary in my pocket 
 how im buryin these artists 
 on a scale of turnt youre minus 
 mine says very yours says hardly 
 and whats scary is you probly can compare me to your car cause im just barely gettin started

 but i aint no jesus 
 i walk on water 
 but only when it freezes  
  
  
 why are expectations so high is it the bar i set 
 my arms i stretch but i cant reach 
 a far cry from it or its in my grasp but as 
 soon as i grab squeeze 
 i lose my grip like the flying trapeze 
 into the dark i plummet now the skys blackening 
 i know the marks high butter 
 flies rip apart my stomach 
 knowin that no matter what bars i come with 
 youre gonna harp gripe and 
 thats a hard vicodin to swallow so i scrap these 
 as pressure increases like khakis 
 i feel the ice cracking because 
  
  
 i walk on water 
 but i aint no jesus 
  
 i walk on water  
 but only when it freezes 
  
 its the curse of the standard that the first of the mathers disc set 
 always in search of the verse that i havent spit yet 
 will this step just be another misstep 
 to tarnish whatever the legacy love or respect 
 ive garnered the rhyme has to be perfect the delivery flawless 
 and it always feels like im hittin the mark 
 til i go sit in the car listen and pick it apart 
 like this shit is garbage 
 gods given me all this still i feel no different regardless 
 kids look to me as a god this is retarded 
 if only they knew its a facade and its exhaustive 
 and i try not to listen to nonsense 
 but if you bitches are tryin to strip me of my confidence 
 mission accomplished 
 im not godsent nas rakim pac big james todd smith 
 and im not prince so 
  
  
 i walk on water 
 but i aint no jesus 
 i walk on water 
  
 but only when it freezes 
  
  
 cause im only human just like you 
 making my mistakes oh if you only knew 
 i dont think you should believe in me the way that you do 
 cause im terrified to let you down oh 
  
  
 its true im a rubiksa beautiful mess 
 at times juvenile yes i goof and i jest 
 a flawed human i guess 
 but im doin my best to not ruin your ex 
 pectations and meet em but first 
 the speedom verse now big sean 
 hes goin too fast is he gonna shout or curse out his mom 
 there was a time i had the world by the balls eatin out my palm 
 every album song i was spazzin the fuck out on 
 and now im gettin clowned and frowned on 
 but the only one whos looking down on 
 me that matters nows deshaun 
 am i lucky to be around this long 
 begs the question though 
 especially after the methadone 
 as yesterday fades and the dresden home 
 is burnt to the ground and all thats left of my house is lawn 
 the crowds are gone 
 and its time to wash out the blonde 
 sales decline the curtains drawn 
 theyre closin the set im still pokin my head from out behind 
 and everyone who has doubt remind 
 now take your best rhyme outdo it now do it a thousand times 
 now let em tell ya the world no longer cares 
 or gives a fuck about your rhymes 
 and as i grow outta site outta mind i might go outta mine 
 cause how do i ever let this mic go without a fight 
 when i made a fuckin tightrope outta twine 
 but when i do fall from these heights though ill be fine 
 i wont pout or cry or spiral down or whine 
 but ill decide if its my final bow this time around cause 
  
 i walk on water 
 but i aint no jesus 
 i walk on water 
 but only when it freezes 
  
  
 cause im only human just like you 
 ive been making my mistakes oh if you only knew 
 i dont think you should believe in me the way that you do 
 cause im terrified to let you down oh 
 if i walked on water i would drown 
  
  
 cause im just a man 
 but as long as i got a mic im godlike 
 so me and you are not alike 
 bitch i wrote stan	and i started from the bottom 
 like a snowmangroundup 
 like round chuck and still put hands on you 
 stayin wound up is how i spend time  
 sucker free confidence high 
 such a breeze when i pen rhymes 
 i just got that air about me like wind chimes  
 nother day in the life  
 used to have to scrape to get by  
 now my communitys gated and i 
 made it and my neighbors say hi  
 im givin em pounds im upscale now 
 guess it means im way in the sky  
 but i still remember the days of 
 minimum wage for general labor 
 welfare recipient since a minor 
 look how government assistance has made ya 
 adversity if at first you dont succeed 
 put your temper to more use 
 cause bein brokes a poor excuse 
 that should only give you more fuel 
 show em why youre you 
 so close god its like i almost got it 
 but close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes 
 so i unabomb shittick tick tickno remorse pew 
 screw it im lit and that attitude i blew up on quick 
 thats why they call me firecracker 
 i grew up on wicwick wick wickwith a short fuse 
 i got some important news to report to 
 anyone who thought i was done nah bitch not quite 
 spotlights back on got my faith wheres yours 
  
 do you still believe in me 
 didnt i give everything i had to give you to make you see 
 ill never forget if you turn your back on me now 
 and walk out i will never let you live it down 
 ill never quit do you still believe in me 
  
  
 man i know sometimes 
 these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice 
 to me theyre just ink blots 
 i just fling em like slingshots and so precise 
 so you might wanna think it over twice  
 or you retards can roll the dice 
 but beef will at least cost you your career 
 cause even my cheap shots are overpriced 
 but this middle fingers free as a bird 
 nuke warhead at birth hugest forehead on earth 
 too short for the verse studied his formula learned 
 how to incorporate a curse 
 point it towards corporate america 
 stick a fork in and turn 
 cause fourletter words are more better heard 
 the world forcefed a turd to me youre getting yours 
 but sometimes i overdo it but i just get so into it 
 i was there consolin you when no one knew it 
 when your situation showed no improvement 
 i was that door you walked over to it 
 im the light at the end of the tunnel 
 so people are always lookin to me as theyre goin through it 
 when that tunnel vision is unclear 
 shit becomes too much to bear 
 since cleanin out my closet 
 when i was havin trouble with the snare 
 im that unrealistic prayer answered 
 and ima get you jacked up like youre tryna fix a flat uh 
 when you struggle with despair 
 that doublefisted bareknuckles coupled with this pair 
 of nuts im cuppin i am your fuck it switch nothin can compare 
  
 do you still believe in me 
 didnt i give everything i had to give you to make you see 
 ill never forget if you turn your back on me now 
 and walk out i will never let you live it down 
 ill never quit do you still believe in me 
  
  
 started from the bottom like a snowman 
 oh man put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that 
 but my batterys low ima need a boost to my pack 
 and i know that i always got proof at my back 
 i called you proof because i knew for a fact 
 my ace in the hole homie im callin on you 
 cause i think im slowly startin to lose faith in it so 
 give me that inkling and mo 
 tivation to go hussein with the flow 
 fake fans that are twofaced didnt show 
 let heartbeats loop produce hate in my soul 
 layin vocals two days in a row 
 true statement hate to go down this road 
 but theres only one route to cross this bridge 
 so i walk in this bitch with loose change 
 cause all my dues paid but this booths takin its toll 
 but its never too late to start a new beginnin 
 that goes for you too so what the fuck you gon do 
 use the tools youre given 
 or youre gon use the cards youre dealt 
 as an excuse for you to not do shit with em 
 i used to play the loservictim 
 til i saw the way proof was driven 
 i found my vehicle and i havent ran out of gas yet 
 and when they stacked decks turn handicaps into assets 
 fanny packs hourglasses 
 if time was on my side id still have none to waste 
 man in my younger days 
 that dream was so much fun to chase 
 its like id run in place 
 while this shit dangled in front of my face 
 but how do you keep up the pace 
 and the hunger pangs once youve won the race 
 when that dual exhaust is coolin off 
 cause you dont got nothin left to prove at all 
 cause you done already hit em with the coup de grce 
 still you feel the need to go full tilt 
 that bruce willis that blue steel that true skill 
 when that wheels loose i wont lose will 
 do you still believe	instinctive nature to bring the anguish  
 to the english language 
 with this ink you haters get rode on like a piece of paper 
 this rap shit got me travelin place to place 
 you barely leave your house 
 cause youre always stuck at your pad its stationary 
 yeah thats why when i brainstorm gotta write it out 
 simon cowell of rhymin foul thats why you sound so shook 
 wire bound notebook got tied around your throat 
 hook it inside your mouth gohruh 
 thats what its like when the mic is out 
 cause im tearin at your flesh with it 
 til your larynx and neck are split 
 with these lyrics weapons expert with 
 like hair extensions extra clips 
 and youre scared to effin death of it 
 bitch youre starin at a legend that 
 in a pair of skechers sweatshirt ripped 
 and hoodie black should be strapped 
 to a chair or stretcher electric swear on every record bitch 
 finger so high in the air ill bet your senses flip 
 like a barometric pressure switch 
 carin less who i offend with this

 and you got strep im too complex with it plex with it

 and ill take a hundred of you hundred of you 
 all at once like i had nothin to lose what can i do 
 my appetite for destruction is loose destruction is loose 
 and all it wants is to have somethin to chew 
 somethin to chew somethin to chew 
  
  
 yeah uh  and still conjoined at 
 the hip with hop still on point and poignant 
 skilled as floyd is 
 in this field and still no filter boy 
 ill put you in your place  like a realtor boy 
 you still aint in the buildin boy 
 i will destroy shit even as i build it 
 get the drill bit pen is filled with poison 
 which is the source easy to still pinpoint it 
  like a real thin joint it 
  comes on quilted northern 
  in a builtin toilet 
  bitch i told you im a dog  
 i wouldnt heal with ointment 
 way im kickin these fairies tails 
 should write a childrens storybook  
 million voices in my head 
 but still get a little bit of thrill and some real enjoyment 
  off the feel of going in 
  like your bitch when she gives me brain 
 like she thinks im dumb 
 grabs the crown of my dick and blows me to kingdom come 
 til i feel anointed 
 she makes iller noises 
 when shes with me must be from the windy city uh 
 pretty apparent shes a milf when blowin me 
 cause i conned her into 
 rippin the condom in two

 that has been the case since back when 
 you last went and threw your hat in the race 
 youve been trash  
 stick your raps in the trash bin 
 or end up in my next rhyme 
 youre a fuckboy so next time 
 its gonna be heads flyin like dez bryant 
 with a tec9 against rex ryan  
 now watch me set it like correct time 
 all you get is sloppy seconds like a timex i 
 clock rejects into the next life 
 talking reckless but its just my 
 strongest suit but you can get my colombian necktie 
 prostitute just climb in the humvee and lets ride 
 why you hitching at night 
 i put an end to your life sex crime 
 kidding aside insidious vibe 
 girl you know you got the prettiest eyes 
 but all youre getting is bribed 
 any old lie to try to get you inside 
 then we gon end up spending the night 
 and im skinning your hide like an indian tribe 
 what kind of nut drives a budweiser truck 
 finds a slut tries to surprise her cuffs ties her up 
 binds up cuts slices her twice 
 but the muff diver must just like it rough 
 fuck right in her vagina blood 
 flies up on the visor like a geyser uh 
  enthusiast of the roofie 
 goal is to get a floozy inside the jacuzzi 
 and have a looseygoosey as cool c is with an uzi 
 but i am to rap what blue jeans mean to bruce springsteen 
 glued we be im trutv youre too pg 
 im schoolly d youre spoonie gee 
 no diss there just notice there

 besides the fact we breathe air 
 happily married to rap and im glad that we buried 
 the hatchet and patched it up

 and im at your mothafuckin throat like

 we may never understand each other its no use 
 we aint ever gonna grasp what each other goes through 
  
  
 black boy black boy we aint gonna lie to you 
 black boy black boy we dont like the sight of you 
 pull up on the side of you 
 window rolled down profile 
 then we wonder why we see this side of you 
 probably comin from the dope house 
 we could let you slide but your tail light is blew out 
 we know youre hidin that heidi klum 
 on you another drug charge homie its back inside for you 
 and just in case a chase might ensue we got that tried and true 
 pistol drew right at you wed be delighted to unload it 
 in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you 
 fucked up but what the fuck am i to do 
 i keep tellin myself keep doin like youre doin 
 no matter how many lives you ruin 
 its for the red white and blue 
 time to go find a new one and split his head right in two 
 no ones ever indicted you 
 why cause youre a 
  
 white boy white boy youre a rockstar 
 my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live 
 white boy white boy in your cop car 
 but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve 
 white boy white boy youre untouchable 
 the worlds coming to an end i dont even care 
 nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar 
  
  
 black boy black boy we dont get your culture and 
 we dont care what our governments done to fuck you over man 
 dont tell us your attitudes a result of that 
 balderdash whered you get the chip on your shoulder at 
 why you kicking that soda can 
 pull your pants up we bout to roll up and 
 throw your ass in the van cuffed 
 you dont have to know our plans or what our intentions are 
 our cards are close to our chest you better show your hands 
 and put our minds more at ease 
 or get shot in the thyroid comply or die boy 
 were fightin a crime war here come the swine 
 tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities 
 thats what we call em pigsties for 
 theyre like eyesores to police 
 talk to you like just a piece of trash 
 feels like were stuck in a time warp to me 
 as i kick these facts and get these mixed reactions 
 as this beat backspins its like were drifting back in 
 to the sixties having black skin is risky 
 cause this keeps happening 
 throughout history africanamericans have been treated like shit 
 and i admit there have been times where its been embarrassin to be a 
  
 white boy white boy youre a rockstar 
 my momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live 
 white boy white boy in your cop car 
 but i dont listen to her cause my head is like a sieve 
 white boy white boy youre untouchable 
 the worlds coming to an end i dont even care 
 nobody can tell me shit cause im a big rockstar 
  
 pt ii 
  
  
 seems like the average lifespan of a white man 
 is more than twice than a black life span 
 i wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner 
 i feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance 
 id rather hear em say die nword than die antwoord 
 ninja now its better disguised banter 
 but thats life strapped cause were strapped financially 
 and cant find answers 
 were applying but mcdonalds 
 seems to be the only franchise thatll hire 
 so how can we have higher standards 
 as dallas overshadows the battle for black lives matter 
 we fight back with violence but acts like that are 
 black eyes on the movement 
 which makes black lives madder 
 at cops and cops madder 
 thats why its at a stalemate 
 and cant arrive at a compromise so its black ops 
 i wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops 
 the block is our backyards officers not the crack spot 
 call the attack dogs off of us man 
 you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop 
 and bad cops fuck it up for the good cops and man stop 
 sendin white cops in the black neighborhoods 
 who aint acclimated to em like thats the way to do it 
 who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns 
 and know nobody black so they act afraid of us 
 and thats racism the fear that a black face gives em 
 a subconscious racist 
 wait why are there black neighborhoods 
 cause america segregated us designated us to an area 
 separated us sectioneightd us 
 when we tear it ups the only time attentions paid to us 
 and education sucks and every days another 
 freddie gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz 
 why is it they treat us like dryer lint 
 we just want a safe environment for our kids 
 but cant escape the sirens 
 dont take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in 
 the poverty that we face so the crime rates the highest in 
 the lowest classes its like a razor wire fence 
 and were trapped in these racial biases 
 that plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise 
 every time we see a devils face 
 lions tigers and bears oh my 
 its more like billy clubs and gats 
 and we really love it when you think were guilty cause were black 
 but you kill each other facts 
 you peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats 
 single mother strugglin through substance abuse 
 while people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes 
 fuck your republican views 
 pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots 
 and streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics 
 or be that into characters just to see that just to be black 
 you better be strapped with a derringer 
 or be capped in america like steve rogers 
 cause no one oversees these cops and 
 all we see is em beat charges 
 we done seen em beat rodney king unconscious and got off 
 so we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings 
 just keep marchin til we reach congress 
 but theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance 
 if you try to slander the flag but 
 somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb 
 so they call it a kaepernick tantrum 
 if you dont stand for the national anthem 
 we raise it you better praise it 
 or youll be made to feel like a traitor well 
 treat you like rodney dangerfield 
 home of the brave is still racist ville 
 so this whole nation feels like a plantation field 
 in a country that claims that its foundation was based on united states ideals 
 that had its natives killed 
 got you singin this starspangled spiel 
 to a piece of cloth that represents the land of the free that made people slaves to build	ive been a liar been a thief

 all my sins need holy water feel it washing over me

 now i cant recall your laughter 
 the smoke of everything go grasp 
 at ends of whats left over 
 and the lights in every broken 
 blownout window screaming laughing 
 i hope to feel it coursing out 
 this is our revival	yeah shout to everybody 
 whos been on this trip with me 
 you dont have to agree 
 but if you feel like me 
  
  
 someone get this aryan a sheet 
 time to bury him so tell him to prepare to get impeached 
 everybody on your feet 
 this is where terrorism and heroism meet square off in the street 
 this chump barely even sleeps 
 all he does is watch fox news like a parrot and repeats 
 while he looks like a canary with a beak 
 why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet hes tryin to divide us 
 this shits like a cult but like johnny hell only unite us 
 cause nothin inside us drives us like this fight does 
 similar to when two cars collide cause 
 our spirits crushed and this spots a tight one 
 but here the jaws of life come 
 to pull us from the wreckage thats what we get pride from 
 when we cant from our stars and stripes cause 
 this type of pickle that were in is hard to deal 
 but theres always tomorrow still 
 if we start from scratch like a scab get the scars to heal 
 and band together for charlottesville 
 and for heather fallen heroes fill this wall with murals 
 nevada get up hit the damn resetter 
 lets start from zero this is our renewal 
 spray tan get rid of get a brand new better 
 america and heres to where it all 
  
 and heres to where we all began all began  
 heres to the land that made me 
 and made me who i am who i am  
 heres to the land that raised me 
 this one for the only place that really knows me 
 for the cracks in the road that drove me 
 theres no place like home 
  
  
 didnt wanna piss your base off did ya 
 cant denounce the klan cause they play golf with ya 
 you stay on twitter way to get your hate off 
 nazi i do not see a way yall differ 
 and all you got are race cards bigot 
 the swastika with your name carved in it 
 should be your trademark cause hates all you played off 
 and you just lick the plate off 
 so i guess it pays to feed off of chaos 
 so basically you ate off hitler 
 but you aint ruinin our country punk 
 or takin our pride from us you wont define us 
 cause like a dictionary things are lookin up 
 so much got a sprained neck know we would rise up 
 against this train wreck and take a stand 
 even if it means sittin when they raise the flag 
 to sing the starspangled banner 
 this man just praised a statue of general lee 
 cause he generally hates the black people degrades hispanics 
 take it back to the shady national convention 
 wish i woulda spit on it before i went to shake his hand 
 at the event or maybe had the wherewithal 
 to know that he was gonna try to tear apart 
 our sacred land we cherish and stand for 
 so hands in the air lets hear it for 
 the start of a brand new america 
 without him and be proud of where were from 
 and heres to where we all 
  
 and heres to where we all began all began  
 heres to the land that made me 
 and made me who i am who i am  
 heres to the land that raised me 
 this one for the only place that really knows me 
 for the cracks in the road that drove me 
 theres no place like home 
  
  
 i wont give up 
 i wont give up on my home that so many died for 
 you already know that i wont give up 
 i wont give up on my home that so many died for 
 you already know 
 theres no place like home no place like home 
 wherever i go no place like home 
 no place like home no place like home 
 wherever i go  
  
  
 and heres to where we all began all began  
 heres to the land that made me 
 and made me who i am who i am  
 heres to the land that raised me 
 this one for the only place that really knows me 
 for the cracks in the road that drove me 
 theres no place like home	we never saw from each others sides or eye to eye 
 just eye for eye lie for lie fight or flight 
 so much baggage need a luggage rack 
 but we carry on with our public spats and our feuds 
 up back in the news love taps when i dissed you 
 like it was fun actually used to run back to the booth 
 jump back in the studio give you a tonguelashing then you 
 laughed at the stomach tat with the tombstone 
 it was funny back in our youth 
 but then it wasnt after we knew 
 that we were done and actually through  
 but if theres one fraction of truth 
 if it could be spun back i would do 
 so many things different  
 cause it was such a dumbass excuse 
 you hit me once and that i would use 
 to continue the pattern of abuse 
 why did i punch back girls your dad is a scumbag im confused 
 because 
  
  
 how come you can be a lord and a loser 
 how come how come you can be a liar and a good father 
 a good dad but a bad husband 
 why are you a good father 
 a great dad but a bad husband 
  
 you were the beat i loved with a writers block 
 the line thats hot that i forgot 
 we laughed a little cried a lot 
 ill never forget when you came home and you held hailie 
 day before you went to jail and daily 
 how wed wait for that mail lady 
 or by the phone for mom to call 
 and i watched you pull yourself up and we decided on 
 givin it one more try despite it all 
 youre my lightning rod when my sky gets dark 
 im your shiny rocks in that tiny box 
 when we tied the knot when we broke the knot 
 every line we crossed we were supposed to not 
 every time we fought the insults they got thrown too far 
 words that we said that we didnt mean 
 the words that we meant that we didnt say 
 the ones that we thought that we shoulda said 
 letters written that we coulda read 
 which maybe woulda led to some good instead 
 and had this put to bed 
 but id be lyin still if i said i wasnt sittin here askin myself 
  
  
 how come you can be a lord and a loser 
 how come how come you can be a liar and a good father 
 a good dad but a bad husband 
 why are you a good father 
 a great dad but a bad husband   
 forever be a hero in my eyes  
 but theres always another side to a good father 
 a great dad but a bad husband 
  
 we brought out the worst in each other 
 someone had to make the sparring end 
 cause i loved you but i hated that me 
 and i dont wanna see that side again 
 but im sorry kim 
 more than you could ever comprehend 
 leavin you was fuckin harder than 
 sawing off a fuckin body limb 
 once upon a time were all we had 
 maybe thats what drew us 
 to each other it was true love 
 shit we never knew was possible 
 we might have loved each other too much 
 and maybe thats what made us do what 
 we did to each other all the screwups 
 cause you always thought that you was 
 more in love with me 
 and i was thinkin i was more in love than you was 
 for all the times that we thought it worked 
 til we saw how wrong we were 
 when the dust settles now and all the dirt 
 if i touch the rawest nerve 
 all i want is for us not to hurt 
 and its been an exhaustive search to find the words 
 but i just heard mockingbird 
 and got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts 
 the purpose was not to stir up or open wounds 
 ive caused a few and so have you 
 or argue whose fault it was 
 partly yours partly mine but really no ones 
 this is so tough im gettin choked up 
 oh fuck it we both suck 
 we broke up got back together 
 we both thought we had forever 
 not bad people just bad together 
 we were so nuts backstabbed each other 
 another blow struck but theres no duckin this blow 
 cause its over and its closure 
 but im not so sure how to close this 
 i just dont know how some people can be so good 
 at one thing and so fucked at a whole nother 
 shit its no wonder 
  
 how come how come you can be a lord and a loser 
 how come how come you can be a liar and a good father 
 a good dad but a bad husband 
 why are you a good father 
 a great dad but a bad husband   
 forever be a hero in my eyes  
 but theres always another side to a good father 
 a great dad but a bad husband	im stumbling i cant see straight 
 and its my fault i got this way 
 i got my hands on something great 
 and found a way to mess it up 
 i did my best i tried to change 
 but its just in my dna 
 i got my hands on something great 
 and found a way to fuck it up again 
  
  
 now im the one thing you couldnt hate more 
 but youre the one thing that i would die for 
  
  
 all my life i was told i was never nothing special 
 i dont need to be reminded of it every other second 
 specially when all my selfesteems 
 already shot to hell im falling helplessly 
 im embarrassed i dont want no one else to see 
 cause i feel like im a piece of shit every time she yells at me 
 selfishly addicted definitely doesnt help that she 
 makes me feel like ive died and gone to heaven 
 but makes life a living hell for me 
 she does that thing with her lip now shes melting me 
 im putty in her palms im wrapped around her finger 
 a yoyo on a string she lets me sit there and just dangle 
 until something better comes along 
 and shell just drop me like a hot potato 
 i look like im in pain but im okay though 
 cause i know she loves memy friends what do they know 
  
 its like im drowning at sea 
 hoping that you reach for me 
 i know youre there but i cant see 
 cause im so drunk off tragic endings 
 im dying to breathe 
 and all you do is strangle me 
 such a beautiful relief 
 cause im so drunk off tragic endings 
  
  
  
 in my moments of weakness 
 i openly admit the shit i wouldnt normally 
 im extremely selfconscious and enormously 
 insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me 
 it only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she 
 gets goin she dont stop when im up shes like a downer 
 when i found her it was love at first encounter 
 but somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter 
 cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for 
 me to walk on when im around her 
 but theres just something about her 
 that makes me not able to function without her 
 how can i get out of it when i dont know how to 
 im a doubter im a pessimist make a believer out of me 
 and show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain 
 cause im going straight down the drain im drowning 
  
 its like im drowning at sea 
 hoping that you reach for me 
 i know youre there but i cant see 
 cause im so drunk off tragic endings 
 im dying to breathe 
 and all you do is strangle me 
 such a beautiful relief

 now im the one thing you couldnt hate more 
 but youre the one thing that i would die for 
  
  
 it took a while for me to get it but i think ive figured it out 
 she dont want me she just dont wanna see me with someone else 
 the idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself 
 to see me falling to pieces brings her joy and brings her health 
 but it annoys her to see me get the strength to say screw her 
 i threw up on myself im dumb sick im addicted to her 
 shes tryna block the door so heres how i do her 
 since im manure shes a sewer 
 and this time this piece of shits running through her 
 i can see the light now im running to it 
 what the fuck shoulda knew it 
 who would think shed actually have the balls to do it 
 as soon as i hopped in it she doused the car with lighter fluid 
 shes standing there with a rag bout to put the lighter to it 
 lit the fucking thing on fire then she threw it 
  
 its like im drowning at sea 
 hoping that you reach for me 
 i know youre there but i cant see 
 cause im so drunk off tragic endings

 having creepy visions of whiskey drinking 
 and envisioning sneaking into where christie brinkley dwells 
 i know this is risky thinking but i wanna stick her like shes decals 
 but when murdering females 
 better pay attention to these details or you could be derailed 
 better wear at least three layers of clothing or be in jail 
 if you get scratched because your dnall 
 be all up under her fingernails 
 man he hears you i dont think he cares 
 he gives a fuck even his pinky swears 
 three personalities burstin out of me please beware 
 her tv blares cant hear the creaking stairs 
 shes unaware in no underwear shes completely bare 
 turns around and screams i remember distinctly

 plus i feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde 
 girl that motherfuckin baton twirler that got dumped in the pond 
 second murder with no recollection of it 
 collectin newspaper articles cuttin out sections from it 
 memorys too fucked to remember destructive temper 
 cut my public defenders jugular then stuck him up in a blender 
 another dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably 
 cause the disassembled body 
 was covered up in the snow since the month of november oddly 
 im wanted for questioning 
 them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

 for  eight women who hate men 
 dont make it no weirder im naked 
 when i break in your basement 
 under your babys play pen i lay in wait adjacent 
 facin the door remainin patient while stayin complacent 
 blatant sexual implications are continuin to get thrown 
 insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems 
 left on your pillow in hopes that when you get home 
 youll get the hint ho im in your window 
 but it never occurred to me i could describe a murder scene 
 in a verse and be charged with first degree 
 cause it just happened to match up perfectly 
 with the massacre or the burger king burglary 
 no officer you see

 please just give me one minute 
 i think i can explain 
 i aint murdered nobody

 walk in the arraignment 
 shoot the bailiff karate kick the plaintiff 
 gotti with the stainless 
 ill just call it shoddy entertainment 
 if yall was in the party gettin faded 
 on molly had the audience sedated 
 you wouldnt catch a body if it fainted 
 probably let it fall and hit the pavement 
 but youd be the first lobbyin to claim it 
 bitch stop bein a lame 
 your hobby isnt robbery and dismemberin body limbs 
 like you was tommy lynn sells 
 and chainsawin them in the basement 
 hardly fits your job description aint nobody dippin 
 out the back of the club like oh my god hes trippin 
 only time you get the blade is 
 probably with the dang lawn equipment aint it 
 wouldnt take a bobby pin and wave it 
 i need to stop bein debated 
 youre still copyin xeroxing 
 im still coppin a feel 
 like bill cosby at will poppin a pill 
 then spill oxys in jills coffee 
 then send her out to the hotel lobby 
 a lil wobbly and still groggy 
 this blond fucks reprehensible 
 misconducts never sensible 
 kiss my butt my set of principles 
 is gone but til i get the president to respond 
 my pen and pencil is a missile launcher 
 and senator mitch mcconnells 
 just as big of a bitch as donald 
 shits on bruh  
 let me sing this shit soprano 
 while i do it pizzicato 
 ivanka stiffarm her while im hittin on melania 
 and this songs for all ya 
  
 cause nobody likes me everybody hates me 
 they want me to go eat some worms  
 and drag my name through the mud through the dirt 
 but ima make you eat your words  
 you can try to hold me down but you better let me up 
 cause youre only gonna make things worse  
 cause i swear when i get up im never gonna let up 
 til everybody eats my turds 
  
  
 these drums and hard snares bring out the worst in me 
 like justin ross harris at a nursery 
 goin ham at candy yam 
 on nanny cam im gettin handies with the zanny xannys 
 in the caddy armrest im imaginin objects 
 so im battin cobwebs from a daddy longleg 
 in hamtramck 
 got the panoramic camera

 im smellin like a damn mechanic 
 with a chick that looks like janet jackson with a spanish accent 
 twice her age and im actin half it  
 grow up 
 nah not that i know of yall 
 basement just got a frickin overhaul 
 got a stripper pole installed 
 started rollin all through those klonopins 
 like a bowlin ball 
 like an overdose on twice the ratio of propofol 
 and go through no withdrawal 
 while i get fellatio and give a facial to 
 an interracial blowup doll of rachel dolezal 
 youre so appalled  
 sos my manager 
 bitch i amateur fuck a pro career 
 coast is clear but nowhere to go from here 
 and nobodys close so dont compare 
 they aint nowhere near im way over here 
 my competition cant see me 
 cause i dont own a mirror 
 but marshall you are terrific 
 so smart and gifted 
 im so narcissistic when i fart i sniff it 
 do a fake dab to smell my armpits whiff it 
 your anxietys throwin gang signs 
 but i made strides with these rape lines 
 im cuttin back on women hate crimes 
 like ray rice when he facetimes 
 bang bang bang bang time 
 dang knivesre butcher than gay wives 
 youre gonna need sutures the same size 
 as the blade i push into caputcha 
 when i pull em like  sleigh rides 
 gotta stab a bitch at least eight times 
 to make it on dateline 
 i came to stake my claim like a canine 
 waitin in a buffet line 
 so kellyanne conway 
 im a really bad hombre 
 come play belly dance on me 
 ive been makin wedding plans all day 
  
 cause nobody likes me everybody hates me 
 they want me to go eat some worms  
 and drag my name through the mud through the dirt 
 but ima make you eat your words  
 you can try to hold me down but you better let me up 
 cause youre only gonna make things worse  
 cause i swear when i get up im never gonna let up 
 til everybody eats my turds 
  
  
 eightyearold with the wordplay 
 girl take this pole like a survey 
 today wasnt my birthday 
 but im caked up like a dessert tray 
 so were in shape 
 cause youre in a slurrin state 
 im a 10 youre an eight  
 like what i do before after and durin rape 
 you wanna get into a pissin contest 
 and find out whos better 
 and be made a fool out of when i pull on em 
 r kelly with a full bladder  
 nonhigh school grad im not a scholar 
 but im so cold when im droppin knowledge 
 my degrees is the same as i got in college  
 but nobodys hotter you owe me my respect 
 i owe you nada like haloti partner 
 blow me told you im so dirty homie you can throw me 
 in some holy water with some floaties on 
 and get the soap and try to get the pope to hold me 
 while you hose me off and nope i wont be washed 
 you hope to god i dont explode 
 i gotta blow this spot up though i got a lotta mo 
 i wont put the sugar coating on it though 
 cause sometimes you can feel like your energys expired 
 raps got you drained 
 dead tired zapped 
 you feel like a wet pile of crap 
 but look man like the feds buggin my phone  
 i get why youre tapped 
 but you gotta get your fire back 
 catch fire get upset and fire back 
 is what i tell myself 
 when times get bad 
 cause sometimes i might get sad 
 but i take the same advice i had 
 and tell myself like i used to tell hailie 
 when lifes a drag 
 told her to do like her dad 
 dont cry get mad 
 cause little baby powders 
 belong in diaper bags 
 im hyper by the time you see this side of me 
 im right in your ass  
 foot up it i stood up for the kid 
 who had to put up with the bullies at his school  
 you aint had to have no money 
 or go shoppin just to cop a fuckin attitude  
 now my doughs amountin to a mountain 
 thats rised too high to count it 
 never asked to be rich all i did was wish 
 i had a dime for every time that i was doubted 
 but then i think about it then im enraged 
 cause i just figured out that if i was paid 
 for the time i spent to put the pen to the page 
 itd be minimum wage  
 but its embedded in my head i never hunted for the bread and butter 
 what i wanted was to be the one that they was scared of but 
 im never gonna get the credit for the sweat and blood 
 i put up in the pen and when im dead i wonder 
 will they put me on a pedestal or forget i was ever this incredible 
 i guess i better go harder than ever cause 
 ill never get another motherfuckin opportunity again 
 to offend as many people with this i can simply because i can 
  
 cause nobody likes me everybody hates me 
 they want me to go eat some worms  
 and drag my name through the mud through the dirt 
 but ima make you eat your words  
 you can try to hold me down but you better let me up 
 cause youre only gonna make things worse  
 cause i swear when i get up im never gonna let up 
 til everybody eats my turds	youre drunk the carpet is burned 
 i hate to find you like this 
 i always find you like this 
 i come home and clean up your mess 
 what would you do without that 
 why do i always come back 
 oh what i wouldnt do for you 
  
  
 and im startin to think that maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
 and im startin to think that maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
  
  
 some nights i want to run for the hills 
 its never easy with you 
 i cannot reason with you 
 but your smile is as rare as it comes 
 what would i do without that 
 maybe thats why i come back 
 oh what i wouldnt do for you 
  
 and im startin to think that maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
 and im startin to think that maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
  
  
 startin to think we were made for each other 
 but one of us in this relationship is raisin the other 
 you remind me of my mother 
 we drive one another crazy as each other 
 and were both adults so theres no excuse 
 for the games that we play with each other 
 where you at at a friends no you aint mothafucker 
 but i give her the benefit of the doubt 
 whenever the doubt kicks in shiver when i touch her 
 cause i love her so much im a sucker 
 how her bottom lip can quiver when shes in trouble 
 shes in hot water think i caught her cheatin again 
 give her another chance another one after that 
 im swimmin in that egyptian river cause im in denial 
 say i dont eat shit but i got a shiteatin grin when i smile 
 makin an excuse for us to act it out 
 shes just actin out with her inner child 
 then i set the truth on fire 
 cause id rather believe a lie 
 then i breathe a sigh of relief i dont believe in 
 goin to bed mad i keep on tryin 
 to make a bad girl good 
 but havent i stood by you in good times 
 and bad im startin to feel like your goddamn dad 
 cause i literally feel like you could die if ever should i 
 leave you for good and never would i 
 itd be all bad never understood why they call it goodbye 
 but i think im a pretty damn good guy 
 and youre a good person too 
 i can save you i can make you change 
 but i keep puttin my fuckin foot in my mouth 
 every time i gotta come and bail you out 
 when you get in trouble that you get yourself in 
 and im in trouble but i cant leave ill sell you out 
 i could never turn my fuckin back on youwhat is that 
 im codependent im just now noticin it 
 but somehow its like every time im about to go to end it 
 i aint got the cojones to do it nor the heart 
 our apartments tore apart 
 youre usin my heart for a dartboard 
 but god mustve aligned stars for us 
 cause somebody paired us up 
 and they say he aint capable of makin a mistake 
 but this ones perfect cause im 
  
 im startin to think that maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
 and im startin to think that maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me 
 maybe you need me	whats in your head in your head

 away from these problems til all of my sorrows i forget

 cause i done spilled all my guts and those are mine so im 
 pickin em up and stuffin em back

 whats in your head in your head 
 zombie zombie zombieieie oh  
  
 it seems to be the reoccurring main theme 
 the shit i would daydream as a kid i was eighteen 
 i went from an irate teenager to still raging 
 as an adult amazing back then i put anything 
 into the rhyme whether it was sad mad happy or angry 
 i spit it the mainstream i hit it 
 yay me i did it did what 
 hailie baby i didnt mean to make you eighty 
 percent of what i rapped about 
 maybe i shoulda did a better job at separating 
 shady and entertaining from real life 
 but this fame thing is still the hardest thing to explain 
 its the craziest shit i 
 ever seen and back then it was like i aint even 
 bothered taking into consideration 
 you one day being older and may hear me say things 
 i didnt  mean and  just aint me 
 okay so ladies and gentlemen 
 lets strip away everything and see the main reason that i 
 feel like a lame piece of shit i sound cranky and bitter 
 complain beef and bicker bout the same things 
 cause when i look at me i dont see what they see 
 i feel ashamed greedy 
 and lately ive been contemplating 
 escaping to get away and go wherever this road takes me 
 its making me crazy whats in my

 i can barely support me but as long as youre healthy 
 thats all that matters for the time being 
 but obviously assuming you will be 
 just thinking ahead ima make it if it kills me 
 lets see how far i can take it with this music 
 im getting sick of chasing this illusion  
 sorry for sloppy writing 
 the pen in my hand is shaking please excuse me 
 dads a little nervous but at the same time excited 
 if i use this same energy while im saying rhymes and write them 
 with the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm 
 as im using in this letter maybe they can feel me as im 
 trying to build these castles out of sand baby girl 
 for you to sit on the throne i got plans baby girl

 i just keep steering ima turn into someone 
 i havent the slightest clue what ima do if it falls through 
 you took your first steps today youll probably walk soon 
 my infinite cd flopped too many soft tunes 
 theyre talking bad about dad its ticking me off too 
 makes me feel like i dont belong or something ooh 
 i think i might have just stumbled onto something new 
 got a prediction for the future im hoping that you 
 open this envelope when youre older and it holds true 
  
 i built this castle

 ive said your name but always tried to hide your face 
 this game is crazy i wanted to claim my love for you but dang 
 i never knew itd be like this if i did i wouldnt have done it 
 you aint asked for none of this shit now youre being punished 
 things that shouldve been private with me and your mother is public 
 i cant stomach they can take this fame back i dont want it 
 ill put out this last album then im done with it 
 onehundred percent finished 
 fed up with it im hanging it up fuck it 
 excuse the cursing baby but just know 
 that im a good person though they portray me as cold 
 and if things should worsen dont take this letter i wrote 
 as a goodbye note but your dads at the end of his rope 
 im sliding down a slippery slope 
 anyways sweetie i better go 
 im getting sleepy love dad shit i dont know	if i could rewind time like a tape 
 inside a boombox one day for every pill or percocet that i ate 
 cut down on the valium ida heard everything 
 but death is turning so definitewait 
 they got me all hooked up to some machine 
 i love you bean didnt want you to know i was struggling 
 feels like im underwater submerged like a submarine 
 just heard that nurse say my liver and kidneys arent functioning 
 been flirtatious with death skirtchasing i guess

 and its your birthday jade im missing your birthday 
 baby girl im sorry i fucking hate when you hurt hai 
 and sweeties thank you for waiting to open gifts

 i go to make a fist but i cant make one im frozen stiff 
 i yell but nothing comes out im crying inside i shout 
 my vocal cords wont permit me i scream but its not aloud 
 you put your arm around momma to calm her wow

 the thought of no more me and you 
 you gave me shoes nikes like new for me for school 
 doody im trying but you you were the glue that binded 
 so many thingstime id give anything to rewind it 
 i had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded 
 by pictures all on my walls and i couldnt sleep at night cause 
 that image burned in my brain of you on that table 
 me falling across your body not able to stand to save you 
 god why did you take him 
 im tryna keep his legacy alive but im dying wheres nathan 
 little ladies be brave take care of your mother 
 smile pretty for pictures always cherish each other 
 ill always love ya and ill be in the back of your memory 
 and i know youll never forget me 
 just dont get sad when remembering 
 and little bro keep making me proud 
 you better marry that girl cause shes faithfully down 
 and when youre exchanging those sacred vows 
 just know that if i could be there i would 
 and should you ever see parenthood i know youll be good at it 
 oh almost forgot to do something thank my father too 
 i actually learned a lot from you 
 you taught me what not to do 
 and mom wish id have had the chance 
 to have one last hearttoheart honest and open talk with you 
 doody i see you i go to walk to you 
 and i can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room 
 nurses lean over the bed pulling tubes out 
 then the sheet over my head shut the room down 
 girls please dont get upset 
 i see them cheeks soaking and wet 
 as you squeeze hold of my neck so forcibly dont wanna let 
 me go pillow drenched emotional wrecks 
 with every second each closer to death 
 but suddenly i feel my heart begin to beat slow 
 then a breath machines go  
 mustve guessed the cheat codes to this shit 
 im tryna rewind time like a tape 
 find an escape make a beeline try and awake 
 from this dream i need to refind my inner strength 
 to remind me even if a steep climb i must take 
 to rewrite a mistake im rewinding the tape 
  
  
 ill put out this last album then im done with it 
 one hundred percent finished fed up with it 
 im hanging it up fuck it 
 excuse the cursing baby but just know 
 that im a good person though they portray me as cold 
 and if things should worsen but i bet you they wont 
 im pledging to throw this methadone in the toilet 
 shred these old letters i wrote 
 all that old pathetic loathing closing credits can roll 
 im proud to be back 
 im bout to like a rematch outdo relapse 
 with recovery mathers lp2 
 help propel me to victory laps 
 gas toward em and fast forward the past 
 consider them last four minutes as 
 the song ida sang to my daughters 
 if ida made it to the hospital less than 2 hours later but i fought it 
 and came back like a boomerang on em 
 now a new day is dawnin 
 im up tuesday its morninnow i know	part 1 produced by s1 and mphazes 
  
  
 its like im in this dirt digging up old hurt 
 tried everything to get my mind off you it wont work 
 all it takes is one song on the radio youre 
 right back on it reminding me all over again 
 how you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt 
 spent a lot of time tryna soul search 
 maybe i needed to grow up a little first 
 well looks like i hit a growth spurt 
 but im coming for closure 
 dont suppose an explanation im owed for 
 the way that you turned your back on me 
 just when i may have needed you most 
 oh you thought it was over you could just close the 
 chapter and go about your life like it was nothing 
 you ruined mine but you seem to be doing fine 
 well ive never recovered 
 but tonight i bet you that what youre 
 bout to go throughs tougher than anything i ever have suffered 
 cant think of a better way to define poetic justice 
 can i hold grudges mind saying let it go fuck this 
 hearts saying i will once i bury this bitch alive 
 hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset 
  
 i flee the scene like it was my last ride 
 you see right through 
 oh you had me pegged the first time 
 you can see the truth but its easier to justify 
 whats bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy 
 i just hate to be the bad guy 
  
 i just hate to be the bad guy 
  
  
  
 and to think i used to think you was the shit bitch 
 to think it was you at one time i worshipped shit 
 think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it 
 not this time you better go and get the sewing kit bitch 
 finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew nitwit 
 thought some time would pass and id forget it forget it 
 you left our family in shambles 
 and you expect me to just get over him pretend he never existed 
 may be gone but hes not forgotten 
 and dont think cause hes been out the picture 
 so long that ive stopped the plotting and still aint coming to get ya 
 youre wrong and that shit was rotten 
 and the way you played hims same shit you did to me cold 
 have you any idea the shit that ive gone through 
 feelings i harbor all this pentup resentment i hold on to 
 not once you call to ask me how im doing 
 letters you dont respond to em 
 fuck it im coming to see you 
 and gee who better to talk to than you 
 the cause of my problems 
 my life is garbage and im bout to take it out on you 
 poof then im gone voosh 
  
 i flee the scene like it was my last ride 
 you see right through 
 oh you had me pegged the first time 
 you can see the truth but its easier to justify 
 whats bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy 
 i just hate to be the bad guy 
  
 i just hate to be the bad guy 
  
  
  
 ive been driving around your side of this town 
 like 9 fricking hours and 45 minutes now 
 finally i found your new address park in your drive 
 feel like ive been waiting on this moment all of my life 
 and its now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva 
 my knife is out and im ducking on the side of your house 
 see its sad it came to this point 
 such a disappointment i had to make this appointment 
 to come and see ya but i aint here for your empathy 
 i dont need your apology or your friendship or sympathy 
 its revenge that i seek 
 so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window 
 like i reach my full potentiali peeked 
 continue to peep still bent low then keep 
 tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo sneak 
 all the way round to the back porch 
 man door handles unlocked shouldnt be that easy to do this 
 you dont plan for intruders beforehand 
 surprised to see me cat got your tongue 
 gag chloroform rag dag almost hackup a lung 
 like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan 
 dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans 
 ironys spectacular huh now whos a faggot you punk 
 and heres your bronco hat 
 you can have that shit back cause they suck 
 its just me you and the music now slim i hope you hear it 
 were in a car right now  wait here comes my favorite lyric 
 im the bad guy who makes fun of people that die 
 and hey heres a sequel to my 
 mathers lp just to try to get people to buy 
 hows this for a publicity stunt this should be fun 
 last album now cause after this youll be officially done 
 eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell 
 bitch i even have your initials 
 i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it 
 since youre in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck 
 the best place you could be buried alive is right here 
 two more exits time is quite near 
 hope we dont get stopped no license i fear 
 that sirens i hear guess 90 on the freeway wasnt the brightest idea as cops appear in my drivers side mirror 
  
 hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least 
 new plan stan 
 slim chauvinist pig drove in this big lincoln town car 
 well gotta go almost at the bridge 
 ha ha big bro its for you slim this is for him 
 and frank ocean oh hope you can swim good 
 now say you hate homos again 
 part 2 produced by streetrunner 
  
  
 i also represent 
 anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend 
 im the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in 
 im your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen 
 perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin 
 nope its hopeless im the denial that youre hopelessly in 
 when they say all of this is approaching its end 
 but you refuse to believe that its over here we go all over again 
 backs to the wall im stacking up all them odds 
 toilets clogged yeah cause im talking a lot of 
 shit but im backing it all up 
 but in my head theres a voice in the back and it hollers 
 after the track is demolished i am your lack of a conscience 
 im the ringing in your ears 
 im the polyps on the back of your tonsils 
 eating your vocal cords after your concerts 
 im your time thats almost up that you havent acknowledged 
 grab for some water 
 but im that pill thats too jagged to swallow 
 im the bullies you hate that you became 
 with every faggot you slaughtered 
 coming back on ya every woman you insult 
 batter but the doublestandard you have 
 when it comes to your daughters 
 i represent everything you take for granted 
 cause marshall mathers the rappers persona 
 is half a facade and matthew and stans just symbolic 
 of you not knowing what you had til its gone 
 cause after all the glitz and the glam 
 no more fans that are calling your name 
 cameras are off sad but it happens to all of them 
 im the hindsight to say i told you so 
 foreshadows of all the things that are to follow 
 im the future thats here to show you what happens tomorrow 
 if you dont stop after they call ya 
 biggest laughing stock of rap who cant call it quits 
 when its time to walk away im every guilt trip 
 the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions 
 if theres anything you have left to say 
 less it makes an impact then dont bother 
 so fore you rest your case 
 better make sure youre packing a wallop 
 so one last time im back 
 fore it fades into black and its all over 
 behold the final chapter in a saga 
 tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle 
 twice the magic that started 
 it all tragic portrait of an artist 
 tortured trapped in his own drawings 
 tap into thoughts blacker and darker 
 than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark 
 uh as we pick up where the last mathers left off	dont kill me 
  
  
 hurry the fuck up 
  
 thank you 
  
 go go go what the fuck the fuck did he go 
 mothafucka bail on me fuck you 
 car stops working 
 aw you gotta be fucking kidding me 
 are you fucking kidding me shit 
  
  
 get off 
  
 haha 
  
 parking lot shit ah 
  
  
 let me see your hands bend over 
  
  
 ah fuck it	yeah yeah 
 yeah yeah yeah 
  marshall 
  i dont have one 
  
  
 my mother reproduced like the komodo dragon 
 and had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in 
 the side of locomotive with rap im 
 loco its like handing a psycho a loaded handgun 
 michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum 
 bout to explode all over the canvas 
 back with the yoda of rap in a spasm 
 your music usually has em 
 but waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt 
 follow you must rick rubin my little padawan 
 a jedi in training colossal brain and 
 thoughts are entertainin 
 but docile and impossible to explain and im also vain and 
 probably find a way to complain about a picasso painting 
 puke skywalker but sound like chewbacca when i talk 
 full of such blind rage i need a seein eye dog 
 cant even find the page i was writing this rhyme on 
 oh its on the rampage 
 couldnt see what i wrote i write small 
 it says ever since i drove a 79 lincoln with whitewalls 
 had a fire in my heart 
 and a dire desire to aspire to die hard 
 so as long as im on the clock punching this time card 
 hiphop aint dying on my watch 
  
 now sometimes when im sleepin 
 she comes to me in my dreams 
 is she taken is she mine 
 dont got time dont care dont have two shits to give 
 let me take you by the hand to promised land 
 and threaten everyone 
 cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing 
  
  
  marshall 
  i dont know him but i wonder 
  ha 
  
  
  
 no if he had 
 he wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad 
 i wouldnt be so mad my attitude wouldnt be so bad 
 yeah dad im the epitome and the prime 
 example of what happens when the power of the rhyme 
 falls into the wrong hands and 
 makes you want to get up and start dancin 
 even if it is charles manson 
 who just happens to be rappin blue lights flashin 
 laughin all the way to the bank lampin in my kmart mansion 
 im in the style department 
 with a pile in my cart rippin the aisle apart but 
 with great power comes 
 absolutely no responsibility for content 
 completely despondent and condescending 
 the king of nonsense and controversy is on a 
 beatkilling spree your honor 
 i must plead guilty cause i sparked a revolution 
 rebel without a cause who caused the evolution 
 of rap to take it to the next level boost it 
 but several rebuked it and whoever produced it 
  
 does that mean it belongs to me 
 cause i just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns 
 that dont honk but every time i speak you hear a beep 
 but lyrically i never hear a peep not even a whisper 
 rappers better stay clear of me bitch cause its the 
  
 its the time of the season 
 when hate runs high 
 and this time i wont give it to you easy 
 when i take back whats mine 
 with pleasured hands 
 and torture everyone that is my plan 
 my job here isnt done 
 cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing 
  
  
  shady 
  i dont give a fuck but i wonder 
  doubt it ha 
  
  
  
 so yeah dadlets walk 
 lets have us a fatherandson talk 
 but i bet we wouldnt probably get one block 
 without me knocking your block off this is all your fault 
 maybe thats why im so bananas i appealed to all those walks 
 of life whoever had strife 
 maybe thats what dad and son talks are like 
 cause i related to the struggles of young america 
 when their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles 
 now theyre rippin out their fuckin hair again its hysterical 
 i chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles 
 yeah uhoh better beware knuckle heads 
 the sign of my hustle says 
 dont knock the doors broken it wont lock 
 it might just fly open get coldcocked 
 you critics come to pay me a visit 
 misery loves company please stay a minute 
 kryptonite to a hypocrite 
 zip your lip if you dish it but cant take it 
 too busy gettin stoned in your glass house 
 to kick rocks then you wonder why i lash out 
 mr mathers as advertised on the flyers so spread the word 
 cause im promoting my passion until im passed out 
 completely braindead rain man 
 doing a bankhead in a restraint chair 
 so bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare 
 or get shanked in the pancreas 
 im angrier than all eight other reindeer 
 put together with chief keef cause i hate every fuckin thang yeah 
 even this rhyme bitch 
 and quit tryin look for a fuckin reason for it that aint there 
 but i still am a criminal 
 tenyearold degenerate grabbin on my genitals 
 the last mathers lp done went diamond 
 this time im predicting this one will go emerald 
 when will the madness end 
 how can it when theres no method to the pad and pen 
 the only message that i have to send 
 is dad im back at it again 
  
 yeah	you fuckin groupie 
 pick up the goddamn phone 
  
  
 bitch where the fuck were you tuesday with who you say

 i used to be the type of kid 
 that would always think the sky is fallin 
 why am i so differently wired am i a martian 
 what kind of twisted experiment am i involved in 
 cause i dont belong in this world 
 thats why im scoffin at authority defiant often 
 flyin off at the handle at my mom 
 no dad so i am noncompliant at home 
 at school im just shy and awkward 
 and i dont need no goddamn psychologist 
 tryna diagnose why i have all these underlyin problems 
 thinkin he can try and solve em 
 im outside chalkin up drawings 
 on the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin 
 to myself either that or inside hidin off in 
 the corner somewhere quiet tryin not to 
 be noticed cause im cryin and sobbin 
 i had a bad day at school so i aint talkin 
 some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin locker 
 cause he said that i eyeballed him 
  
 and if you fall ill get you there 
 ill be your savior from all the wars 
 that are fought inside your world 
 please have faith in my words 
  
  
 cause this is my legacy legacy yeah 
 this is my legacy legacy yeah 
 theres no guarantee 
 its not up to me we can only see 
 this is my legacy legacy legacy legacy 
  
  
 i used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin 
 why am i so differently wired in my noggin 
 cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mindbogglin 
 cause i obsess on everything in my mind small shit 
 bothers me but not my father he said sayonara 
 then split but i dont give a shit 
 im fine long as theres batteries in my walkman 
 nothing is the matter with me 
 shit look on the bright side at least i aint walkin 
 i bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment 
 complex on a tenspeed which ive acquired parts that 
 i find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it 
 headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit 
 but if this is all there is for me life offers 
 why bother even tryin to put up a fight its nonsense 
 but i think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience 
 what about them rhymes ive been jottin 
 they are kind of giving me confidence 
 instead of tryin to escape through my comics 
 why dont i just blast a little something like onyx 
 to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that 
 say what i wanna say to the kid that said that i eyeballed him 
 grab hold of my balls like thats right fights on bitch 
 who woulda knew from the moment i turned the mic on that 
 i could be iconic in my conquest 
 thats word to phife dawg from a tribe called quest 
  
 this is my legacy legacy yeah 
 this is my legacy legacy yeah 
 theres no guarantee 
 its not up to me we can only see 
 this is my legacy legacy legacy legacy 
  
  
 i used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin 
 now i think the fact that im differently wireds awesome 
 cause if i wasnt i wouldnt be able to work words like this 
 and connect lines like crosswords 
 and use my enemys words as strength 
 to try and draw from and get inspired off em 
 cause all my life i was told and taught i am not shit 
 by you wack fuckin giant sacks of lyin dog shit 
 now you shut up bitch i am talkin 
 thought i was full of horseshit 
 and now you fuckin worship the ground on which i am walkin 
 me against the world so what im brian dawkins 
 versus the whole 016 lions offense 
 so bring on the giants falcons and miami dolphins 
 its the body bag game bitch im supplyin coffins 
 cause you dicks butt kiss bunch of brian baldingers 
 youre gon die a balllicker ive been diabolical 
 with this dialogue since 99 rawkus 
 you dont respect the legacy i leave behind yall can 
 suck a dick the day you beat me pigsll fly out my ass 
 in a flyin saucer full of italian sausage 
 the most high exaltin and i aint haltin 
 til i die of exhaustion inhale my exhaust fumes 
 the best part about me is i am not you 
 im me and im the fire marshall and this is my 
  
 this is my legacy legacy yeah 
 this is my legacy legacy yeah 
 theres no guarantee 
 its not up to me we can only see 
 this is my legacy legacy legacy legacy	came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain 
 an asshole that role i think i succeeded fulfillin 
 but dont think i ever stopped 
 to think that i was speakin to children 
 everything was happenin so fast 
 it was like i blinkedsold three million 
 then it all went blank all i remember is feelin ridiculous 
 cause i was gettin sick of this feelin 
 like im always under attack man 
 i could have stacked my shit list to the ceilin 
 women dishin but really thinkin if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him 
 guess im a little bit of a hypocrite when im rippin shit 
 but since when did this many people ever give a shit 
 what i had to say its just my opinion 
 if it contradicts how im livin put a dick in your rear end 
 thats why every time you mentioned a lyric 
 i thanked you for it for drawin more attention toward it 
 cause it gave me an enormous platform 
 im flattered you thought i was that important 
 but you cant ignore the fact that i fought for the respect 
 and battled for it mad awards had glaad annoyed 
 attaboy they told me to slow down id just zone out 
 good luck tryin to convince a blonde 
 its like tellin gwen stefani she sold out 
 cause i was tryna leave no doubt 
 in anyones mind one day id go down in history 
 think they know now because everybody knows 
  
 everybody knows 
 that youre just an asshole 
 everywhere that you go 
 people wanna go home everyone knows 
 everybody knows 
 so dont pretend to be nice 
 theres no place you can hide 
 you are just an asshole 
 everyone knows everyone knows 
  
  
 thanks for the support asshole scratch 
 thanks for the support asshole 
  
  
 quit actin salty i was countin on you to count me out 
 ask asher roth when he roundabout 
 dissed me to shout me out 
 thought i was history well goddamn honky 
 that compliments like backhandin a donkey 
 good way to get your ass socked in the mouth

 or you better not come out

 so what if insults are revoltin 
 even helen keller knows life stinks 
 you think its a joke til youre bulletriddled 
 but you should give little shit what i think 
 this whole world is a mess 
 gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest 
 and a glock just to go watch batman 
 who needs to test a testicles not that man 
 half of you dont got the guts intestinal blockage 
 rest of you got lap bands 
 stuck to this motto fore they put bath salts 
 and all those water bottles in colorado so get lost waldo 
 my souls escapin through this asshole that is gapin 
 a black hole and im swallowin this track whole

 cause you been a gold digger since you was a minor 
 been tryna hunt me down like a dog 
 cause youre on my ass but you cant get a cent 
 cause all of my spare time is spent 
 on my nose in this binder so dont bother tryin 
 only women that i love are my daughters 
 but sometimes i rhyme and it sounds like i forget im a father 
 and i push it farther 
 so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line 
 its apparent i shouldnt have been a parent 
 ill never grow up so to hell with your parents 
 and motherfuck father time 
 it aint never gonna stop a pessimist 
 who transformed to an optimist in his prime 
 so even if im halfdead im halfalive

 and dry up your teardrops im here 
 white americas mirror so dont feel awkward or weird

 shouldnt be a shock because everybody knows 
  
 everybody knows 
 that youre just an asshole

 everybody knows 
 so dont pretend to be nice

 im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god 
 all my people from the front to the back nod back nod 
 now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box 
 they said i rap like a robot so call me rapbot 
  
  
 but for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes 
 i got a laptop in my back pocket 
 my penll go off when i halfcock it 
 got a fat knot from that rap profit 
 made a livin and a killin off it 
 ever since bill clinton was still in office 
 with monica lewinsky feelin on his nutsack 
 im an mc still as honest 
 but as rude and as indecent as all hell 
 syllables skillaholic  
 this flippity dippityhippity hiphop 
 you dont really wanna get into a pissin match 
 with this rappity brat packin a mac in the back of the ac 
 backpack rap crap yapyap yacketyyack 
 and at the exact same time i attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while im practicin that 
 ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table 
 over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half 
 only realized it was ironic i was signed to aftermath after the fact 
 how could i not blow all i do is drop fbombs 
 feel my wrath of attack 
 rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad 
 its actually disastrously bad for the wack 
 while im masterfully constructing this masterpice 
  
 cause im beginnin to feel like a rap god rap god 
 all my people from the front to the back nod back nod 
 now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box 
 let me show you maintainin this shit aint that hard that hard 
 everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like  have got 
  
  
 well to be truthful the blueprints 
 simply rage and youthful exuberance 
 everybody loves to root for a nuisance 
 hit the earth like an asteroid 
 did nothing but shoot for the moon since  
 mcs get taken to school with this music 
 cause i use it as a vehicle to bus the rhyme 
 now i lead a new school full of students 
 me im a product of rakim 
 lakim shabazz 2pac nwa cube hey doc ren 
 yella eazy thank you they got slim 
 inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position 
 to meet rundmc induct them 
 into the motherfuckin rock and roll hall of fame 
 even though ill walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames 
 only hall of fame ill be inducted in is the alcohol of fame 
 on the wall of shame 
 you fags think its all a game til i walk a flock of flames 
 off a plank and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin 
 little gaylookin boy

 the way im racin around the track call me nascar nascar 
 dale earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god 
 kneel before general zod 
 this planets kryptonno asgard asgard 
  
  
 so youll be thor and ill be odin 
 you rodent im omnipotent 
 let off then im reloadin 
 immediately with these bombs im totin 
 and i should not be woken 
 im the walkin dead but im just a talkin head a zombie floatin 
 but i got your mom deepthroatin 
 im out my ramen noodle 
 we have nothin in common poodle 
 im a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil 
 its me my honestys brutal 
 but its honestly futile if i dont utilize what i do though 
 for good at least once in a while 
 so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes 
 to maybe try to help get some people through tough times 
 but i gotta keep a few punchlines 
 just in case cause even you unsigned 
 rappers are hungry lookin at me like its lunchtime 
 i know there was a time where once i 
 was king of the underground 
 but i still rap like im on my pharoahe monch grind 
 so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine 
 appeal with the skin color of mine 
 you get too big and here they come tryin 
 to censor you like that one line 
 i said on im back from the mathers lp 1 when i 
 tried to say ill take seven kids from columbine 
 put em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 
 see if i get away with it now that i aint as big as i was but im 
 morphin into an immortal comin through the portal 
 youre stuck in a time warp from 2004 though 
 and i dont know what the fuck that you rhyme for 
 youre pointless as rapunzel with fuckin cornrows 
 you write normal fuck being normal 
 and i just bought a new raygun from the future 
 just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad 
 cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweathers pad 
 singin to a man while he played piano 
 man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel 
 so ray j went straight to the radio station 
 the very next day hey fab ima kill you 
 lyrics comin at you at supersonic speed  
 uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin im a human 
 what i gotta do to get it through to you im superhuman 
 innovative and im made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and itll glue to you and 
 im devastating more than ever demonstrating 
 how to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating 
 never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting 
 for the day that they can say i fell off theyll be celebrating 
 cause i know the way to get em motivated 
 i make elevating music you make elevator music 
 oh hes too mainstream 
 well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it 
 its not hiphop its popcause i found a hella way to fuse it 
 with rock shock rap with doc 
 throw on lose yourself and make em lose it 
 i dont know how to make songs like that 
 i dont know what words to use 
 let me know when it occurs to you 
 while im rippin any one of these verses that versus you 
 its curtains im inadvertently hurtin you 
 how many verses i gotta murder to 
 prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too 
 ugh school flunky pill junkie 
 but look at the accolades these skills brung me 
 full of myself but still hungry 
 i bully myself cause i make me do what i put my mind to 
 and im a million leagues above you 
 ill when i speak in tongues but its still tongueincheek fuck you 
 im drunk so satan take the fucking wheel 
 ima sleep in the front seat 
 bumpin heavy d and the boyz still chunky but funky 
 but in my head theres something i can feel tugging and struggling 
 angels fight with devils and heres what they want from me 
 theyre askin me to eliminate some of the women hate 
 but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred 
 i have then you may be a little patient 
 and more sympathetic to the situation 
 and understand the discrimination 
 but fuck it lifes handin you lemons make lemonade then 
 but if i cant batter the women 
 how the fuck am i supposed to bake them a cake then 
 dont mistake him for satan its a fatal mistake 
 if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation 
 to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and 
 dont be a retardbe a king think not 
 why be a king when you can be a god	or eminem has a full line of chainsaws 
 eminem eminem eminem eminem eminem eminem 
 marshall mathers eminem the rapper eminem 
 who can say for sure perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer if science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use society would reap a great benefit

 maybe thats why i cant leave detroit 
 its the motivation that keeps me goin 
 this is the inspiration i need 
 i could never turn my back on a city that made me 
 and	somethings burnin i cant figure out what  
 its either lust or a cloud of dust 
 judgement is clouded must 
 just be the powder from the power of  
 but im in something i dont know how to get out of 
 left my girl in the house alone 
 is that my soontobespouses moan 
 and the further i walk the louder 
 pause for a minute to make certain thats what i heard 
 cause after all this is her place 
 so i give her the benefit of the doubt i 
 think i might be about to bust her bust her 
 the thoughts scary yo though and it hurtsbrace 
 hope it aint here we go yo 
 cause my head already goes to worstcase 
 scenario though in the first place  
 but you confirmed my lowend theory though 
 shouldve known when i made it all the way to third base 
 and that was only the first date 
 couldve made it to home plate 
 but you slid straight for the dome and dove face first

 she screamed she loved me like she never did before 
  
  
 and i told her go where you wanna

 and i told her go where you wanna

 so needless to say im feelin betrayed 
 snatch my house key off her key chain 
 she jumps off weebey from the wires dick 
 now shes chasin me with a cheese grater 
 here goes that broken record clich 
 its all my fault anyway shes turnin the tables im a beatbreak 
 she treats my face like serato she cuts and scratches like a dj 
 each day is an instant replay 
 they say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior 
 back together but forgot today was her bday 
 she cut me off on the freeway 
 simple misunderstanding but just as i went to slam on the brakes 
 thats when i realized that she may be crazy as me wait 
 bitch cut my fuckin brakeline 
 stepped on them fuckers eight times 
 still goin seventythree thank god theres an exit comin up 
 what the motherfucks wrong with her 
 hit the off ramp til i coasted to a goshdamn halt 
 hit a fuckin tree now here she comes at full speed 
 shes racin at me okay you wanna fuck with me eh 
 snatch that bitch out her car through the window 
 she screamin i body slam her on the cement 
 until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole 
 buried the stink ho in it then paid to have the street repaved 
  woke up in a dream state 
 in a cold sweat like i got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave 
 guess i eventually caved though cause shes layin next to me in beddirectly aimin a gat at my head 
 woke up again and jumped up 
 like fuck it ive had it im checkin into rehab 
 i confess im a static addict i guess thats why im so clingy 
 every girl ive ever had either says i got too much baggage 
 or im too fuckin dramatic 
 man what the fuck is the matter im just a fuckin romantic 
 i fuckin love you you fuckin bitch 
 combative possessive in fact last time i was mad at an ex 
 i actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events 
 i said hit the road then after she left 
 i sent that bitch a text that said be careful driving 
 dont read this and have an accident 
 she glanced to look at it and wrecked  
 too bad thought we had a connect 
 no sense dwelling makes never been a more compelling case 
 than the model covered in loral and mace 
 who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin 
 while the whore was yellin rape 
 til her vocal cords were swellin 
 and her voice were more hoarser than tori spellings face 
 still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates 
 to greet norman bates with a warm embrace 
 less youre andrea yates dont ask me for a date though 
 youre late well the sentiments great 
 but wait think theres been a mistake 
 you wanted an intimate date i wanna intimidate 
 i have infinite hate in my blood 
 its mainly cause of the game of  
 wait dinner at eight i have infinite hate in my blood 
 its mainly cause of the 
  
 game of love love love love 
 lalalalala love	mom i know i let you down 
 and though you say the days are happy 
 why is the power off and im fucked up 
 and mom i know hes not around 
 but dont you place the blame on me 
 as you pour yourself another drink yeah 
  
  
 i guess we are who we are 
 headlights shining in the dark night i drive on 
 maybe we took this too far 
  
  
 i went in headfirst never thinkin about who what i said hurt 
 in what verse my mom probably got it the worst 
 the brunt of it but as stubborn as we are did i take it too far 
 cleanin out my closet and all them other songs 
 but regardless i dont hate you cause ma 
 youre still beautiful to me cause youre my mom 
 though far be it from you to be calm 
 our house was vietnam desert storm 
 and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb 
 equivalent to chemical warfare 
 and forever we could drag this on and on 
 but agree to disagree that gift for me 
 up under the christmas tree dont mean shit to me 
 youre kickin me out its 15 degrees 
 and its christmas eve little prick just leave 
 ma let me grab my fucking coat 
 anything to have each others goats 
 why we always at each others throats 
 especially when dad he fucked us both 
 were in the same fuckin boat 
 youd think thatd make us close  
 further away it drove us but together headlights shine 
 and a car full of belongings still got a ways to go 
 back to grandmas house its straight up the road 
 and i was the man of the house the oldest 
 so my shoulders carried the weight of the load 
 then nate got taken away by the state at eight years old 
 and thats when i realized you were sick 
 and it wasnt fixable or changeable 
 and to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though but 
  
 i guess we are who we are 
 headlights shining in the dark night i drive on 
 maybe we took this too far 
  
  
 cause to this day we remain estranged and i hate it though 
 cause you aint even get to witness your grandbabies grow 
 but im sorry momma for cleanin out my closet 
 at the time i was angry rightfully maybe so 
 never meant that far to take it though 
 cause now i know its not your fault and im not makin jokes 
 that song i no longer play at shows 
 and i cringe every time its on the radio 
 and i think of nathan being placed in a home 
 and all the medicine you fed us and 
 how i just wanted you to taste your own 
 but now the medications takin over 
 and your mental states deterioratin slow 
 and im way too old to cry this shit is painful though 
 but ma i forgive you so does nathan yo 
 all you did all you said you did your best to raise us both 
 foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours 
 but i love you debbie mathers 
 oh what a tangled web we have cause 
 one thing i never asked was 
 where the fuck my deadbeat dad was 
 fuck it i guess he had trouble keepin up with every address 
 but ida flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus 
 owned a collection of maps 
 and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas 
 if someone ever moved em from me 
 that you coulda bet your asses 
 if i had to come down the chimney dressed as santa kidnap em 
 and although one has only met their grandma once 
 you pulled up in our drive one night 
 as we were leavin to get some hamburgers 
 me her and nate we introduced you hugged you 
 and as you left i had this overwhelming sadness 
 come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and 
 i saw your headlights as i looked back 
 and im mad i didnt get the chance to 
 thank you for being my mom and my dad 
 so mom please accept this as a 
 tribute i wrote this on the jet i guess i had to 
 get this off my chest i hope i get the chance to 
 lay it fore im dead the stewardess said to fasten 
 my seatbelt i guess were crashin 
 so if im not dreamin i hope you get this message that 
 i will always love you from afar cause youre my mom 
  
 i guess we are who we are 
 headlights shining in the dark night i drive on 
 maybe we took this too far 
  
  
 i want a new life  
 one without a cause  
 so im coming home tonight  
 well no matter what the cost 
 and if the plane goes down 
 or if the crew cant wake me up 
 well just know that im alright 
 i was not afraid to die 
 oh even if theres songs to sing 
 well my children will carry me 
 just know that im alright 
 i was not afraid to die 
 because i put my faith in my little girls 
 so ill never say goodbye cruel world 
 just know that im alright 
 i am not afraid to die 
  
  
 i guess we are who we are 
 headlights shining in the dark night i drive on 
 maybe we took this too far 
 i want a new life	yeah 
 tryna figure out the difference 
 but i thinkthink the lines are starting to get blurred 
  
  
 im in a strange place 
 i feel like mae when he gave up the game for his faith 
 i feel like im caged in these chains and restraints 
 grimmin every stranger in the place while i gaze into space 
 cause im mentally rearrangin his face 
 i need a change of pace 
 cause the pace im workin ats dangerous 
 theres nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst 
 i done quit chicken heads cold turkey 
 and started slowly roastin em 
 cause thats where most of my anger is based 
 fuck your feelings 
 i feel like i play for the saints 
 i just wanna hurt youaim for the skanks 
 then aim for all these fake kanyes jays waynes and the drakes 
 im frustrated cause aint no more nsync now im all out of whack 
 im all out of backstreet boys to call out and attack 
 im goin all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is im strapped for battle 
 suck a duck crawl out the backits a bar fight 
 prepare your arsenal 
 and beware of bar stools flyin through the air and bottles breakin mirrors also 
 and i aint stoppin til the swear jars full 
 you done called every woman a slut but youre forgetting sarah marshall  
 oh my bad slut and next time i show up to court 
 ill be naked and just wear a law suit 
 judge be like thats sharp 
 how much that motherfucker cost you smartass 
 youre lucky i dont tear it off you 
 and jump your bones you sexy motherfucker 
 youre so fuckin gravy marshall i should start callin you au jus 
 cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo 
 evil twin take this beat now its all you 
 i believe people can change but only for the worse 
 i coulda changed the world if it wasnt for this verseso satanic 
 kmart chains panic cause they cant even spin back the curse words 
 cause theyre worse when theyre reversed motherfucker 
 rekcufrehtom  tihs  
 and these kids are like parrots 
 they run around the house just like terrorists 
 screamin fuck shit fuck 
 adult with a childishlike arrogance 
 wild ever since the day i came out i was like merits 
 fuck that id rather be loud and i like swearin 
 from the first album even the gals were like tight lyrics dreamy eyes 
 but my fuckin mouth was nightmarish 
 and from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite 
 sometimes i listen and revisit them old albums often as i can and skim through all them bitches to make sure i keep up with my competition  
 hogger of beats hoarder of rhymes 
 borderline genius whos bored of his lines 
 and that sort of defines where im at and the way i feel now 
 feel like i might just strike first then ignore the replies 
  
 theres darkness closing in  there it goes again  
 it controls my pen  but that aint me its my evil twin 
  
 but hes just a friend  who pops up now and again  
 so dont blame me  blame him its my evil twin 
  
  
  
 welcome back to the land of the living my friend 
 you have slept for quite some time 
  
  
 so whos left lady gaga mess with the bieber 
 nah f with christina 
 i aint fuckin with either jessica neither simpson or alba

 get the chloraseptic excedrin aleve or 
 extra strength tylenol 3s

 bedridden and destined never to leave the 
 bedroom ever again like the legend of heathuh 
 ledger 
 my suicide notes barely legible read the 
 bottom its signed by the joker 
 lorena said i never can leave her 
 shell sever my wiener i ever deceive her

 when on the steps i met deshaun at osborn 
 id never make it to sophomore 
 i just wanted to skip school and rap 
 used to mop floors flip burgers and wash dishes 
 while i wrote rhymes tryna get props for em 
 cause i took book smarts and swapped for em 
 they were sleepin i made em stop snorin 
 made em break out the popcorn 
 now ive been hip hop in its tiptop form 
 since nwa was blarin through my car windows 
 leanin on the horn screamin fuck the police like cop porn 
 flipped rap on its ear like i dropped corn 
 fuck top five bitch im top four 
 and that includes biggie and pac whore 
 and i got an evil twin

 ho im only vulnerable when i got a boner 
 superman try to fuck me over it wont hurt 
 dont try to fix me im broke so i dont work 
 so are you but youre broke cause you dont work 
 but all bullshit aside i hit a stride 
 still shady inside hair every bit as dyed 
 as it used to be when i first introduced yall to my skittish side 
 and blamed it on him when they tried to criticize 
 cause we are the same 
 bitch	im friends with the monster thats under my bed 
 get along with the voices inside of my head 
 youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath 
 and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy 
  
  
 i wanted the fame but not the cover of newsweek 
 oh well guess beggars cant be choosey 
 wanted to receive attention for my music 
 wanted to be left alone in public excuse me 
 for wantin my cake and eat it too and wantin it both ways 
 fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated 
 when i blew see but it was confusing 
 cause all i wanted to dos be the bruce lee of loose leaf 
 abused ink used it as a tool when i blew steam 
 whoo hit the lottery oohwee 
 but with what i gave up to get it was bittersweet 
 it was like winnin a used mink 
 ironic cause i think im gettin so huge i need a shrink 
 im beginnin to lose sleep one sheep two sheep 
 goin coocoo and kooky as kool keith 
 but im actually weirder than you think cause im 
  
  
 im friends with the monster thats under my bed 
 get along with the voices inside of my head 
 youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath 
 and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy 
 well thats nothin  
  
 well thats nothin  
  
  
 now i aint much of a poet 
 but i know somebody once told me to seize the moment 
 and dont squander it cause you never know when it all 
 could be over tomorrow so i keep conjurin 
 sometimes i wonder where these thoughts spawn from 
 yeah ponderinll do you wonders 
 no wonder youre losin your mind the way it wanders 
 yodelodelayheehoo i think it went wanderin off down yonder 
 and stumbled onto jeff vanvonderen 
 cause i need an interventionist 
 to intervene between me and this monster 
 and save me from myself and all this conflict 
 cause the very thing that i loves killin me and i cant conquer it 
 my ocds conkin me in the head keep knockin 
 nobodys home im sleepwalkin 
 im just relayin what the voice in my heads sayin 
 dont shoot the messenger im just friends with the 
  
  
 im friends with the monster thats under my bed 
 get along with the voices inside of my head 
 youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath 
 and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy 
 well thats nothin  
  
 well thats nothin  
  
  
 call me crazy but i have this vision one day that 
 ill walk amongst you a regular civilian 
 but until then drums get killed and 
 im comin straight at mcs blood gets spilled and 
 ill take you back to the days that id get on a dre track 
 give every kid who got played that pumpedup feelin 
 and shit to say back to the kids who played him 
 i aint here to save the fuckin children 
 but if one kid out of a hundred million 
 who are goin through a struggle feels it and relates thats great 
 its payback russell wilson fallin way back 
 in the draft turn nothin into somethin still can make that 
 straw into gold chump i will spinrumpelstiltskin in a haystack 
 maybe i need a straightjacket 
 face facts i am nuts for real but im okay with that 
 its nothin im still friends with the 
  
  
 im friends with the monster thats under my bed 
 get along with the voices inside of my head 
 youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath 
 and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy 
  
  
 im friends with the monster thats under my bed 
  get along with the voices inside of my head 
  youre tryin to save me stop holdin your breath 
  and you think im crazy yeah you think im crazy 
 well thats nothin 
  
  
  
 well thats nothin	im a little nutty and i know it but if you go back and take a look at my history 
 you will see that i am not the only one whos off his rocker there were many before me 
 i was always labeled the black sheep of the family what a bad seed id grow to be 
 but if you take a look at us now youll see the apple didnt fall too far from the tree 
  
  
 haha haha haha haha 
 alright look 
 imma tell you the story from my side 
 maybe youll understand check it out 
  
  
 you done witnessed unexplainable shit 
 too insane to explain people run from what they just dont get 
 maybe shady should have just hit em with a little bit 
 did i spit too soon should i have spoon fed em it 
 but i was just so eager to prove i was even 
 worth bein in the same league or the room 
 of the people of whom i was in 
 every now and then i look up like i was seekin approval 
 was it because of the pigment of my skin 
 or was it a figment of my imagination 
 maybe it bothered me more than it did them 
 maybe it wasnt a big deal back then 
 but to me it was see what it was 
 was i had developed a complex from being judged 
 proof spit his verse now im next lets see who balks 
 im in the booth staring back to see whose mugs 
 i get a reaction from usually the first thumb 
 was from proof and the rest of the crew backed him up 
 and no one lied to each other cause none of us had deals 
 it was real we just wanted tickets for that meal 
  
 sometimes i feel like its just me 
 sometimes i feel like im goin crazy 
 but take a look at my family 
 cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree 
 i said sometimes i feel like its just me 
 sometimes i feel like im goin crazy 
 but take a look at my family 
 cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree 
  
  
 ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg 
 cause she said that i had a baby sister 
 who fell out of the window i was too young to remember 
 kansas city projects i was like fivesix 
 and how come i remember malcolm isaac and boogy 
 if it was the projects in missouri 
 cause those were my best friends until isaac 
 took my tricycle and my uncle todd went to try to go get it back 
 and ended up gettin jumped and cut in the gut 
 with a switch and seventysome stitches 
 which is to this day why my mother still tries to show me some old fake picture 
 of a fictitious little sister who never existed 
 and this is why a part of my lifes so twisted 
 but i can never be as sick as that bitch is 
 and by the way that pictures one of my relatives 
  
 sometimes i feel like its just me 
 sometimes i feel like im goin crazy 
 but take a look at my family 
 cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree 
 i said sometimes i feel like its just me 
 sometimes i feel like im goin crazy 
 but take a look at my family 
 cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree 
  
  
 you probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain 
 to see why everything i say is so insane 
 whats different about my brain 
 that separates me from other players in this game 
 on the surface it may seem like a scheme 
 or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy 
 but thats the last thing i need 
 is for people to walk around feelin sorry for me 
 and i am not a g never claimed to be 
 i gave my vest to cashis just hope he dont need it more than me 
 but well see cause we aint lookin for beef 
 but if it comes our way what do we turn the other cheek come on 
  
  
 sometimes i feel like its just me 
 sometimes i feel like im goin crazy 
 but take a look at my family 
 cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree 
 i said sometimes i feel like its just me 
 sometimes i feel like im goin crazy 
 but take a look at my family 
 cause the apple dont fall too far from the tree 
  
 yeah and im the crazy one right 
 whatever then let me be the crazy one

 what the fuck good does that do me now 
 but somehow i know youre near me in presence 
 oh i went and dropped some presents off for easter 
 to them two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their 
 minds a little and dog youll never believe this 
 but sharonda actually talks to me nowjesus 
 and everyone else is just tryin to pick up the pieces 
 man how could you touch so many fuckin lives and just leave us 
 they say grievance has a way of affectin everyone different 
 if its true how the fuck im sposed to get over you 
 difficult as it sounds 
  
  
 doody i drop a tear in a rhyme 
 the day you find it is the day i stop missin deshaun 
 holton it was written it was woven 
 for a soldier to leave so suddenly got me wide open 
 how could god take a soul so dope and 
 turn around leave us all heartbroken 
 know that youre sayin keep goin 
 be a man no emotion its your duty 
 until we meet again doody 
  
 doody thats what wed call each other 
 i dont know where it came from 
 but it just stuck with us we was always brothers 
 never thought about each others skin colors 
 til one day we was walkin up the block in the summer 
 it was like 90 degrees i was catchin a sunburn 
 tryin to walk under the trees just to give me some comfort 
 im moanin i just wanna get home and 
 i look over and your shirt is off 
 im like youre gonna fry youre like no i wont 
 im black stupid and black people they got melatonin 
 in their skinwe dont burn meanwhile my face is glowin 
 and i feel like im on fire 
 and the entire time youre just laughin at me 
 and snappin at me with your shirt bastard 
 and i still have to get you back for that shit 
 and by the way them playboy rings my mother stole from you 
 well nate finally got em back shit 
 it mustve been at least 16 years ago 
 well i put em in your caskoww 
 movin past it it still aint registered yet 
 but you can bet your legacy theyll never forget 
 the motor city motown hip hop vet 
 hip hop shop dreads it dont stop there 
 yeah as difficult as it sounds 
  
 doody i drop a tear in a rhyme 
 the day you find it is the day i stop missin deshaun 
 holton it was written it was woven 
 for a soldier to leave so suddenly got me wide open 
 how could god take a soul so dope and 
 turn around leave us all heartbroken 
 know that youre sayin keep goin 
 be a man no emotion its your duty 
 until we meet again doody 
  
  
 and this might sound a little strange but ima tell it 
 i found that jacket that you left at my wedding 
 and i picked it up to smell it 
 i wrapped it up in plastic until i put it in glass 
 and hang up in the hallway so i can always look at it 
 and as for all me and d12 we feel like fuck rap 
 it feels like our general just fuckin died in our lap 
 we shut off all our pagers all our cell numbers is changed 
 our twoways are in the trash 
 so some cats will have to find a new way 
 and i know it feels like the dreams will die with you today 
 but the truth is theyre all still here and you aint 
 purple gang you gotta keep pressin on 
 dont ever give up the dream dog i got love for you all 
 and doody its true you brought people together 
 who never woulda been in the same room if it wasnt for you 
 you were the peacemaker doody 
 i know sometimes you were moody 
 but you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding 
 but you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin 
 if it had to happen it had to happen 
 believe me i know youre the one who taught me to throw them bows back on dresden 
 from eggin cars to paintballin gettin arrested 
 to sittin across from each other in cells laughin and jestin 
 they tried to hit us for five years for that no question 
 i guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didnt show up for court so we got off on a technicality left sweatin 
 me you and whats his face i forgot his fuckin name 
 shame he even came to your funeral he betrayed our team 
 and if i see him again ima punch him in the fuckin face 
 and thats on hailie jade whitney laine and alainas name 
 i let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot 
 in the air for you and pour some liquor out 
 with obie in the parking lot of 54 just before 
 we were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more 
 difficult as it sounds 
  
 doody	obie the person that came up introverted 
 cause of nervousness that was solely the only verdict 
 it was worth it cause he changed became so observant 
 servin such of a purpose 
 if you knew him earlier in his days its like a different version 
 so much hurtin and pain gave him game for certain 
 thats why its curtains in this murder if you get him worked up 
 im so assertive on these muthafuckas acting tougher 
 had enough of isolatin myself in a room 
 writing poems and songs doing the same in school 
 now look what he became a fool 
 cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you 
 livin hard but still julliard 
 a god walks and aint spend a day in the pew 
 regardless of this i draw visual pictures when a nigga vents 
 so welcome to the art department 
  
  
 i stimulate the brain mimic emulate the sane 
 cynics keep on thinkin its a fuckin gimmick when it aint 
 clinically insane brain is on venus up uranus 
 label me a genius if you ever seen us you would say 
 he may seem as though hes plain normal if you ever meet him 
 greet him with a shake see he aint as mean as what they say 
 see the thing is maybe he cant always think of things to say 
 so hes vague so they mistake him for bein crazed 
 you part ways your impression of him changed 
 you dont think hes strange you turn around and tell him peace and thanks 
 you catch him flippin you off with his pants down 
 hands around his scrotum tuckin his fuckin penis between his legs

 they spot me they chase a nigga down two blocks 
 two shots in the air for niggas that aint here 
 two tone two door grey top blue floor 
 green guap galore in and out of new hall 
 that bright light you saw was a paparazzi flash 
 im tryna snap a picture through your maserati glass 
  
  
 we on the grind 
 all the time 
 aint bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine 
 i keep a nine 
 to see the shine 
 i might let your ass slide this time 
 while i get this paper 
 cause im a celebrity 
 ghettocelebrity 
 aint nothing changed nigga 
  
 there are enough insults in my head to fill up a swear jar 
 and have it overflowing 
 so dont get me going dont dare start 
 youll never see me again amelia earhart 
 im popping a wheelie off to a really unfair start 
 im past grinding for me  guess i just be grounded up 
 like ground round or a pound of chuck 
 tightlywound as fuck 
 til the fire marshalls come shut 
 fire marshall down and up 
 i suggest you better shut the fuck up 
 and stop fucking around and duck 
 i aint playing this time i told you im out for blood 
 so to say i keep it 100 would probably sound redundant 
 like calling a bitch a ho or asking a gal to suck 
 and blow on your dick cock is she up to screwing down to fuck 
 its a mans world and im trapped in a land of smut 
 with a thousand sluts strapped and muzzled 
 running through a house of mutts 
 in other words im shutting every one of you bitches mouths up 
 and im watching my language if i tell you to kiss my fucking butt 
 and aint shit changed my shit still dont stink player 
 my farts may have gotten staler ever since 
 i became a trailer park celebrity 
 maybe my complexion became a little paler 
 poster child for white trash 
 im a garbage pail kid sailor yeah 
 see me im all up on your bitch means ima rape her 
 all i got for these hoes is dick duct tape and a stapler 
 so bitch you better look for table scraps to scrape up 
 i dont subscribe to the news or the free press 
 but homie i get the paper 
 fucking stupid	it is not about lyrics anymore 
 its about a hot beat and a catchy hook 
  
  
 if we gotta dumb down our style and abc it 
 then so be it cause nowadays these kids just 
 dont give a shit bout lyrics 
 all they wanna hear is a beat and thats it 
 long as they can go to the club and get blitzed 
 pick up some chicks and get some digits 
 and the djs playing them hits 
 oh this my jam this my shit 
 we dont know a word to a verse all we know is the chorus 
 cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us 
 and the songs ginormous the whole formulas switched 
 cause we dont know anymore what are hits 
 is it the beat is it the rap 
 is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap 
 and how do we adapt and get trl votes 
 when thirteenyearolds control the remotes 
 and ashlees got a brand new nose 
 we gotta put some new emphasis on our syllalables 
  
  
 if the emphasis on the compact disc 
 is in the beat then im gon feature em and get rich 
 and let dre mix the shit and drive off in the range ro 
 cause everywhere i go they love the blingbling flow 
 bangbang look at the way my chain glow 
 the ring on my fing cost your man a lot of dough  
 the fuck am i bustin my brain fo 
 its just the way the game go and oh it takes two to tango 
 you call this a lame flow you bought the shit 
 i guess you to blame too i just found an angle  
 no more reality flow 
 im tryna time my album dropping with a reality show 
 cock the mac11 in front of hot 97 
 and call my publicist tell her we in press heaven  
 no one gives a shit except 
 some kids that just got into sex on the internet 
 so you want the chatroom or the house in malibu 
 em your emphasis is on the wrong syllalable 
  
 they said thirtys the new twenty funny 
 must mean fortys the new thirty interesting 
 cause ever since then its been in a sense an extension 
 for veteran rappers that are better than half of 
 the shit coming out right now its all trash 
 the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed 
 jay said its his last then 50 and em 
 then what detox drops what do we got then 
 so now our whole camps is running around 
 scrambling over what to do 
 gambling every time we put a record out 
 just lookin for that hook  
  
  
 shorty i love you 
 and you love me too 
 we were meant to be 
 cause shorty you love me 
 and i love you too 
 and i promise ill be true to you

 fore the history of rap is gone with a snap 
 a snare and a clap what happened to just spittin 
 bout livin in the motherfuckin city you at 
 in the grimiest condition i breathe in drama 
 king mathers and cashmethats free karma 
 im everything anything you can never be

 i speak with a piece no peace on my mind 
 i repeat every evil deed done of mine

 now get out there and sell some goddamn records 
 now get out there and sell some goddamn records 
 now get out there and sell some goddamn records 
 now get out there and sell some goddamn records 
 now get out there and sell some goddamn records 
 now get out there and sell some goddamn records 
 now get out there and sell some goddamn records 
 now get out there and sell some	and im willing to borrow your grass 
 but i specialize in eating mcs 
 in the immortal words of ll cool j 
 as he would say im a goat 
 and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is 
 it means the greatest of all time 
 and i consider myself one of those 
 so thank you very much here it goes 
  
  
 this is the part i was worried about 
 everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes 
 and im in some dusty garage 
 inhalin them carbon monoxide fumes 
 and everyones tellin me what i should do 
 and how i should come out and what to rap about 
 and i know i got a lot up 
 in my medulla oblongata that i gotta get out 
 and im not sure how this is gonna come off 
 theyre probably gonna think that im comin off as cocky 
 like i just started givin a fuck what you really think about me 
 see the thing about me 
 is you dont really know a thing about me 
 everyones makin a stink about me 
 like theres some kind of an aura of that of the king around me 
 surround me with nothin but gangsters 
 killers and bangers and the most dangerous criminals 
 and i feel like im more comfortable around them 
 than i do my own motherfuckin neighbors 
 but see my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when i leave 
 but why does it seem like im not even put up in the same category as other mcs 
 so when weezy says that hes better than jay z 
 please be that just subliminally 
 means he thinks jiggas the best 
 and that hes the only one up in that league see 
 and its easy just to consider me 
 one of the greatest white rappers there is 
 knowin goddamn well that im one of the best motherfuckin rappers who ever lived period 
  
 im a goat and i dont mean to gloat 
 but i know what i know and i know what you think 
 and these magazinesll never put it in ink 
 because how would it look if they considered me as a goat 
 and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is 
 it means the greatest of all time 
 and i consider myself one of those 
 so thank you very much here it goes 
  
  
 maybe they figure that im on my way out the game 
 so they gotta go try to find em a new eminem or a new shady 
 if they think its gonna happen man i thought i was crazy 
 or maybe i could be takin it wrong 
 and theyre tryna pay homage to me in a strange way 
 so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way 
 see you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin up that paul walls white 
 cause lyrically he doesnt pose a threat to anyone see hes just aight 
 and bubba sparxxx he just wont write 
 because hes so caught up in that snow white 
 that timbaland cant even get him in the studio 
 hes so gone off that coke right 
 and its so sad cause hes dope right 
 americas next great white hope right 
 so now they feel like they gotta come up with some cornyass white rapper show right 
 and which im still havin mixed feelings about 
 they said itd be real im just spillin it out 
 theres somethin about a white boy talkin black 
 and runnin around with a damn grill in his mouth 
 and i love when the say that tiger woods shit 
 isnt it ironic that the best rappers white 
 and the best golfers black 
 and im the one whos gotta catch all the flack off of that 
 but these are the people who never had heard of an eminem until 8 mile had came out 
 but i had already hit middle america 
 parents had all got to likin me now 
 when suddenly i wasnt such a bad guy 
 all of the hatred for me mustve died 
 thought i committed career suicide 
 so i had to turn back into the bad guy 
 so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays 
 anatomy god made raggedy ann and andy 
 not raggedy andy and andy and andy 
 and angelina jolie is just another ho 
 and brad is a sucka because once i fuck her 
 she wants to go to somalia to adopt another baby 
 you know what i say  no 
 you better save some of them kids from madonna 
 she needs all the publicity she can get 
 you wanted shady well you got it man i aint apologizin for shit 
  
 im a goat and i dont mean to gloat 
 but i know what i know and i know what you think 
 and these magazinesll never put it in ink 
 because how would it look 
 if they considered me as a goat 
 and for those of yall who dont know what a goat is 
 it means the greatest of all time 
 and i consider myself one of those 
 so thank you very much here it goes 
  
  
 man im takin my ball and goin home 
 man shit is too easy 
 nobody even wants to pass me the ball 
 cause im a goat 
 so dont worry im out the motherfuckin game 
 and yall can sit and argue about whos the motherfuckin best 
 but yall know that im a goat 
 and like i said im one of the motherfuckin best 
 before you get your panties in a motherfuckin bunch 
 but before i go id like to say fuck you very much 
 to everybody who wasnt there from the start 
 and thank you very much to everybody who was 
 and yall aint gotta say it just think it 
 cause i know that you know that i know 
 that you know that i know that im a goat

 he aint givin them shit he says hell pinch a penny so hard 
 hell leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark 
 with the scars til abraham lincoln is screamin out ahh 
 these metaphors and similes aint similar to them not at all

 instead of suckin him off 
 they can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by 
 like david carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die 
 and eat shit while they at it hes fuckin had it 
 hes mad at the whole world 
 so go to hell and build a snowman girl 
 the bullies become bullied and pussies get pushed 
 then they better pull me take me back to 9th grade to school me 
 cause i aint lookin back only forward this whole spot blowin 
 who coulda known hed grow to be a poet and not know it 
 and while im bein poetic let me get it stoic and raise the bar 
 higher than my opinion of these womens been lowered 
 so bear witness to some biblical shit theres a cold wind blowin

 and bearing with me over these last couple of years

 i was goin through growin pains 
 hatred was flowin through my veins 
 on the verge of goin insane 
 i almost made a song dissin lil wayne

 i felt horrible about myself he was spittin and i wasnt 
 anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it 
 almost went at kanye too 
 god it feels like im goin psychotic thank god that i didnt do it 
 ida had my ass handed to me and i knew it 
 but proof wasnt here to see me through it 
 im in the booth poppin another pill tryna talk myself into it

 bottoms up on the pill bottle maybe ill hit my bottom tomorrow 
 my sorrow echoes in this hall though  
 but i must be talkin to the wall though i dont see nobody else 
  
 but all these other rappers suck is all that i know 
 ive turned into a hater i put up a false bravado 
 but marshall is not an egomaniac thats not his motto 
 hes not a desperado hes desperate 
 his thoughts are bottled inside him 
 one foot on the brake one on the throttle 
 fallin asleep with writers block in the parkin lot of mcdonalds 
 but instead of feeling sorry for yourself 
 do something bout it admit you got a problem 
 your brain is clouded you pouted long enough 
 it isnt them its you you fuckin baby 
 quit worryin bout what they do and do shady 
 im fuckin goin crazy 
  
 is anybody out there

 no one seems to know my struggle 
 and everything ive come from

 yeah 
 so why in the world do i feel so alone 
 nobody but me im on my own 
 is there anyone out there who feels the way i feel 
 if there is then lend me an ear 
 just so i know that im not the only one

 cause i aint playin around 
 theres a game called circle and i dont know how 
 im way too up to back down

 admittedly i probably did it subliminally for you 
 so i could come back a brandnew me 
 you helped see me through 
 and dont even realize what you did believe me you 
 ive been through the wringer 
 but they can do little to the middle finger 
 i think i got a tear in my eye i feel like the king of 
 my world haters can make like bees with no stingers 
 and drop dead no more beef lingers 
 no more drama from now on i promise 
 to focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father 
 so i solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters 
 and raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it 
 cause the way i feel im strong enough to go to the club 
 or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up 
 cause im raisin the bar 
 id shoot for the moon but im too busy gazin at stars 
 i feel amazin and im

 as i fall deeper into a manic state 
 im a prime candidate for the gene 
 to receive the drug addict trait 
 blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate 
 i seem to gravitate to the bottle of nyquil then i salivate 
 start off with the nyquil like i think ill just have a taste 
 couple of sips of that then i gradually graduate 
 to a harder prescription drug called valium 
 like yeah thats great 
 i go to just take one and i end up like having eight 
 now i need something in my stomach cause i havent ate 
 maybe ill grab a plate of nachos and ill have a steak 
 and youd think that with all i have at stake 
 look at my daughters face 
 mommy something is wrong with dad i think 
 hes acting weird again hes really beginning to scare me 
 wont shave his beard again and he pretends he doesnt hear me 
 and all he does is eat doritos and cheetos 
 and he just fell asleep in his car eating 3 musketeers in the rear seat 
  
 sometimes i feel so alone i just dont know 
 feels like i been down this road before 
 so lonely and cold its like something takes over me 
 as soon as i go home and close the door 
 kinda feels like dj vu 
 i wanna get away from this place i do 
 but i cant and i wont say i try but i know 
 thats a lie cause i dont 
 and why i just dont know 
  
  
 maybe just a nice cold brew whats a beer 
 thats the devil in my ear ive been sober a fuckin year 
 and that fucker still talks to me hes all i can fucking hear 
 marshall come on well watch the game 
 its the cowboys and buccaneers 
 and maybe if i just drink half 
 ill be halfbuzzed for half of the time 
 whos the mastermind behind that little line 
 with that kind of rationale man i got half a mind 
 to have another half a glass of wine 
 sounds asinine yeah i know 
 but i never had no problem with alcohol 
 ouch look out for the wall aim for the couch im bout to fall 
 i miss the couch and down i go lookin like a bouncy ball 
 shit mustve knocked me out cause i aint feel the ground at all 
 wow what the fuck happened last night where am i 
 man fuck am i hungover and goddamn i got a headache 
 shit half a vicodin why cant i 
 all systems ready for take off please stand by 
  
 sometimes i feel so alone i just dont know 
 feels like i been down this road before 
 so lonely and cold its like something takes over me 
 as soon as i go home and close the door 
 kinda feels like dj vu 
 i wanna get away from this place i do 
 but i cant and i wont say i try but i know 
 thats a lie cause i dont 
 and why i just dont know 
  
  
 so i take a vicodin splash it hits my stomach then  
 couple of weeks go by it aint even like im gettin high 
 now i need it just not to feel sick yeah im gettin by 
 wouldnt even be taking this shit if deshaun didnt die 
 oh yeah theres an excuse you lose proof so you use 
 theres new rules its cool if its helpin you to get through 
 its twelvenoon aint no harm in selfinducin a snooze 
 what else is new fuck it what would elvis do in your shoes 
 now here i am three months later fullblown relapse 
 just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax 
 and since im convinced that im an insomniac 
 i need these pills to be able to sleep so i take three naps 
 just to be able to function throughout the day lets see 
 thats an ambien each nap how many valium three 
 and that will average out to about one good hours sleep 
 okay so now ya see the reason how come he 
 has taken four years to just put out an album b 
 see me and you we almost had the same outcome heath 
 cause that christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing 
 it was bologna was it the methadone ya think 
 or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos 
 your vcr tape cases with your ambien cr 
 great places to hide em aint it so you can lie to hailie 
 im going beddybye whitney baby good night alaina 
 go in the room and shut the bedroom door 
 and wake up in an ambulance 
 they said they found me on the bathroom floor damn 
  
 sometimes i feel so alone i just dont know 
 feels like i been down this road before 
 so lonely and cold its like something takes over me 
 as soon as i go home and close the door 
 kinda feels like dj vu 
 i wanna get away from this place i do 
 but i cant and i wont say i try but i know thats a lie 
 cause i dont and why i just dont know	lately ive been hard to reach 
 ive been too long on my own 
 everybody has a private world 
 where they can be alone 
 are you calling me 
 are you trying to get through 
 are you reaching out for me 
 then im reaching out for you 
  
  
 im just so fuckin depressed 
 i just cant seem to get out this slump 
 if i could just get over this hump 
 but i need somethin to pull me out this dump 
 i took my bruises took my lumps 
 fell down and i got right back up 
 but i need that spark to get psyched back up 
 in order for me to pick the mic back up 
 i dont know how or why or when 
 i ended up in this position im in 
 im starting to feel distant again 
 so i decided just to pick this pen 
 up and try to make an attempt to vent 
 but i just cant admit 
 or come to grips with the fact that i may be done with rap 
 i need a new outlet 
 and i know some shits so hard to swallow 
 but i just cant sit back and wallow 
 in my own sorrow but i know one fact 
 ill be one tough act to follow 
 one tough act to follow ill be one tough act to follow 
 here today gone tomorrow 
 but youd have to walk a thousand miles 
  
 in my shoes just to see 
 what its like to be me 
 ill be you lets trade shoes 
 just to see what itd be like to 
 feel your pain you feel mine 
 go inside each others minds 
 just to see what we find 
 look at shit through each others eyes 
  
  
 but dont let em say you aint beautiful 
 they can all get fucked just stay true to you 
 dont let em say you aint beautiful 
 they can all get fucked just stay true to you 
  
  
 i think im starting to lose my sense of humor 
 everythings so tense and gloom 
 i almost feel like i gotta check the temperature 
 of the room just as soon as 
 i walk in its like all eyes on me 
 so i try to avoid any eye contact 
 cause if i do that then it opens a door 
 for conversation like i want that 
 im not lookin for extra attention 
 i just wanna be just like you 
 blend in with the rest of the room 
 maybe just point me to the closest restroom 
 i dont need no fuckin man servant 
 tryna follow me around and wipe my ass 
 laugh at every single joke i crack 
 and half of em aint even funny like ha 
 marshall youre so funny man 
 you should be a comedian goddamn 
 unfortunately i am 
 i just hide behind the tears of a clown 
 so why dont you all sit down 
 listen to the tale im about to tell 
 hell we dont gotta trade our shoes 
 and you aint gotta walk no thousand miles 
  
 in my shoes just to see 
 what its like to be me 
 ill be you lets trade shoes 
 just to see what itd be like to 
 feel your pain you feel mine 
 go inside each others minds 
 just to see what we find 
 look at shit through each others eyes 
  
  
 but dont let em say you aint beautiful 
 they can all get fucked just stay true to you 
 dont let em say you aint beautiful 
 they can all get fucked just stay true to you 
  
  
 nobody asked for life to deal us 
 with these bullshit hands were dealt 
 we gotta take these cards ourselves 
 and flip em dont expect no help 
 now i couldve either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned 
 or take this situation in which im placed in 
 and get up and get my own 
 i was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags 
 and sat on the porch and hoped and prayed 
 for a dad to show up who never did 
 i just wanted to fit in in every single place every school i went 
 i dreamed of being that cool kid 
 even if it meant acting stupid 
 aunt edna always told me 
 keep making that face itll get stuck like that 
 meanwhile im just standin there 
 holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this 
 til i stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old 
 i learned my lesson then 
 cause i wasnt tryin to impress my friends no mo 
 but i already told you my whole life story 
 not just based on my description 
 cause where you see it from where youre sittin 
 its probably 110 different 
 i guess we would have to walk a mile in each others shoes at least 
 what size you wear i wear 10s 
 lets see if you can fit your feet 
  
 in my shoes just to see 
 what its like to be me 
 ill be you lets trade shoes 
 just to see what itd be like to 
 feel your pain you feel mine 
 go inside each others minds 
 just to see what we find 
 look at shit through each others eyes 
  
  
 but dont let em say you aint beautiful 
 they can all get fucked just stay true to you 
 dont let em say you aint beautiful 
 they can all get fucked just stay true to you

 i was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face him 
 tell him why look him dead in the eye then waste him 
 and the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell 
 then swallow the shell all the hollow who dwell 
 in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls

 shady records recording artist obie trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head in what appears to be a random driveby shooting 
 meanwhile eminem is rumored to be alienated 
 on againoff again relationship with 
 this just in a tour bus involving eminems bus 
 updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an afterhours club weve learned that the rapper proof has been fatally shot 
 shadyaftermath recording artist 
 longtime best friend of eminem and a member of the rap group d12 
 d12 back in the news again today 
 is it a sabbatical or the end the rumors and speculation continue to swirl around eminem 
 he insists hes just taking a break but doubters believe hes retiring leaving us all to ask will the real slim shady please stand up 
  
  
 so this is it this is what i wished for 
 just isnt how i envisioned it fame to the point of imprisonment 
 i just thought the shitd be different 
 but somethin changed the minute that i got a whiff of it 
 i started to inhale it smell it started sniffin it 
 and it became my cocaine i just couldnt quit 
 i just wanted a little bit then it turned me to a monster 
 i became a hypocrite concert after concert 
 i was rakin in the dough rollin in green 
 had the game hemmed up like a sewing machine 
 but i was losing my freedom there was nowhere for me 
 to not go and be seen and just go and be me 
 and there was no inbetween you either loved it or hate it 
 every cd critics gave it a three then three 
 years later they go back and rerate it 
 then called the slim shady lp the greatest 
 the marshall mathers was a classic 
 the eminem show was fantastic 
 but encore just didnt have the caliber to match it 
 i guess enough time just aint passed yet 
 a couple more years that shitll be illmatic 
 and eight years later im still at it 
 divorced remarried a felon a father sleeping pill addict 
 and this is real talk i feel like the incredible hulk 
 my back has been broke and i can still walk 
  
 so be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it 
 and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it 
 cause it might just come back on you tenfold 
 i said be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it 
 and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it 
 cause it might just come back on you tenfold 
  
  
 i got a letter from a fan that said hes been praying for me 
 every day and for some reason 
 its been weighing on my mind heavy 
 cause i dont read every letter i get 
 but something told me to go ahead and open it 
 but why would someone pray for you 
 when they dont know you 
 you didnt pray for me when i was local 
 and as i lay these vocals i think of all the shit i had to go through 
 just to get to where im at ive already told you 
 at least a thousand times in these rhymes 
 i appreciate the prayer but ive already got god on my side 
 and its been one hell of a ride hasnt it 
 just watching it from a opposite standpoint 
 man boys got to look 
 nuts and thats the only word i can think of 
 right now on how to describe the shit 
 this is like a vibe you get go ahead and bop to it 
 just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit 
  
 so be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it 
 and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it 
 cause it might just come back on you tenfold 
 i said be careful what you wish for cause you just might get it 
 and if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it 
 cause it might just come back on you tenfold	burps woo

 i sit back with this pack of zigzags and this bag 
 of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be 
 the most meanest mc on this on this earth 
 and since birth ive been cursed with this curse to just curse 
 and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works 
 and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve 
 all this tension dispensin these sentences 
 gettin this stress thats been eatin me recently off 
 of this chest and i rest again peacefully  
 but at least have the decency in you 
 to leave me alone when you freaks see me out 
 in the streets when im eatin or feedin my daughter 
 to not come and speak to me  i dont know you 
 and no i dont owe you a motherfuckin thing 
 im not mr nsync im not what your friends think 
 im not mr friendly i can be a prick 
 if you tempt me my tank is on empty  
 no patience is in me and if you offend me 
 im liftin you ten feet  in the air 
 i dont care who was there and who saw me just jaw you 
 go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit 
 ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
 im tired of all you  i dont mean to be mean 
 but thats all i can be its just me 
  
 and i am whatever you say i am 
 if i wasnt then why would i say i am 
 in the paper the news every day i am 
 radio wont even play my jam 
 cause i am whatever you say i am 
 if i wasnt then why would i say i am 
 in the paper the news every day i am 
 i dont know thats just the way i am 
  
  
 sometimes i just feel like my father i hate to be bothered 
 with all of this nonsense its constant 
 and oh its his lyrical content 
 the song guilty conscience has gotten such rotten responses 
 and all of this controversy circles me 
 and it seems like the media immediately 
 points a finger at me  
 so i point one back at em but not the index or pinkie 
 or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up 
 when you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up 
 with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too 
 when a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school 
 and they blame it on marilyn  and the heroin 
 where were the parents at and look where its at 
 middle america now its a tragedy 
 now its so sad to see an upperclass city 
 havin this happenin  then attack 
 eminem cause i rap this way  but im glad 
 cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire to burn 
 and its burnin and i have returned 
  
 and i am whatever you say i am 
 if i wasnt then why would i say i am 
 in the paper the news every day i am 
 radio wont even play my jam 
 cause i am whatever you say i am 
 if i wasnt then why would i say i am 
 in the paper the news every day i am 
 i dont know thats just the way i am 
  
  
 im so sick and tired of bein admired 
 that i wish that i would just die or get fired 
 and dropped from my label lets stop with the fables 
 im not gonna be able to top a my name is 
 and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation 
 to cop me rotation at rock n roll stations 
 and i just do not got the patience  
 to deal with these cocky caucasians 
 who think im some wigger who just tries to be black cause i talk 
 with an accent and grab on my balls so they always 
 keep askin the same fuckin questions  
 what school did i go to what hood i grew up in 
 the why the who what when the where and the how 
 til im grabbin my hair and im tearin it out 
 cause they drivin me crazy  i cant take it 
 im racin im pacin i stand and i sit 
 and im thankful for every fan that i get 
 but i cant take a shit in the bathroom without 
 someone standin by it  no i wont sign your autograph

 cause i am whatever you say i am 
 if i wasnt then why would i say i am 
 in the paper the news every day i am 
 radio wont even play my jam 
 cause i am whatever you say i am 
 if i wasnt then why would i say i am 
 in the paper the news every day i am

 and in the car they found a tape but they didnt say who it was to 
 come to think about it his name wasit was you 
  
  
 damn	look if you had one shot or one opportunity 
 to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment 
 would you capture it or just let it slip yo 
  
  
 his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy 
 theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti 
 hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
 to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting 
 what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud 
 he opens his mouth but the words wont come out 
 hes choking how everybodys joking now 
 the clocks run out times up overblaow 
 snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope 
 there goes rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont 
 give up that easy no he wont have it he knows 
 his whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope 
 he knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows 
 when he goes back to this mobile home thats when its 
 back to the lab again yo this old rap shit he 
 better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him and 
  
  
 you better lose yourself in the music 
 the moment you own it you better never let it go

 his souls escaping through this hole that is gaping 
 this world is mine for the taking make me king 
 as we move toward a new world order 
 a normal life is boring but superstardoms 
 close to postmortem it only grows harder 
 homie grows hotter he blows its all over 
 these hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows 
 hes known as the globetrotter lonely roads 
 god only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father 
 he goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
 but hold your nose cause here goes the cold water 
 these hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product 
 they moved on to the next schmoe who flows 
 he nosedove and sold nada and so the soap opera 
 is told it unfolds i suppose its old partner 
 but the beat goes on dadadom dadom dahdah dahdah 
  
  
 you better lose yourself in the music 
 the moment you own it you better never let it go  
 you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
 this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo 
 you better lose yourself in the music 
 the moment you own it you better never let it go  
 you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
 this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo 
 you better 
  
 no more games ima change what you call rage 
 tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged 
 i was playin in the beginning the mood all changed 
 ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
 but i kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher 
 best believe somebodys payin the pied piper 
 all the pain inside amplified by the 
 fact that i cant get by with my nineto 
 five and i cant provide the right type of life for my family 
 cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers 
 and theres no movie theres no mekhi phifer this is my life 
 and these times are so hard and its gettin even harder 
 tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter 
 caught up between bein a father and a prima donna 
 baby mama drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna 
 stay in one spot another day of monotonys 
 gotten me to the point im like a snail ive got 
 to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot 
 success is my only motherfuckin optionfailures not 
 mom i love you but this trailers got 
 to go i cannot grow old in salems lot 
 so here i go its my shot feet fail me not 
 this may be the only opportunity that i got

 the moment you own it you better never let it go  
 you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow 
 this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo 
 you better lose yourself in the music

 i aint leavin without you bitch 
 comin home with me 
 and my boy and his boy  and his boy and his girl 
 haha nate dogg	these ideas are nightmares to white parents 
 whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings 
 like whatever they say has no bearing 
 its so scary in a house that allows no swearing 
 to see him walkin around with his headphones blarin 
 alone in his own zone cold and he dont care hes 
 a problem child and what bothers him all comes out 
 when he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out  
 cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out 
 if he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out 
 his thoughts are wacked hes mad so hes talkin back 
 talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap 
 he sags his pants dorags and a stockin cap 
 his stepfather hit him so he socked him back 
 and broke his nose his house is a broken home 
 theres no control he just lets his emotions go 
  
  
  sing with me  sing for the year  
 sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  
 sing it with me its just for today 
 maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away 
  
  
 entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters 
 in the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum 
 holy or unholy only have one homie 
 only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me 
 yet everybody just feels like they can relate  
 i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great 
 or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate 
 its like these kids hang on every single statement we make 
 like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum 
 now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen 
 from standin on corners and porches just rappin 
 to havin a fortune no more kissin ass 
 but then these critics crucify you  journalists try to burn you 
 fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you 
 to get they hands on every dime you have 
 they want you to lose your mind every time you mad 
 so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon 
 any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns 
 thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me 
 strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly 
 but all they kids be listenin to me religiously 
 so im signin cds while police fingerprint me 
 theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me 
 if im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense b 
 its all political if my music is literal 
 and im a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl 
 i couldnt i wouldnt be fit to 
 youre full of shit too guerrera that was a fist that hit you  
  
  sing with me  sing for the year  
 sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  
 sing it with me its just for today 
 maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away 
  
  
 they say music can alter moods and talk to you 
 well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too 
 well if it can then the next time you assault a dude 
 just tell the judge it was my fault and ill get sued 
 see what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols 
 and they wanna get one cause they think the shits cool 
 not knowin we really just protectin ourselves 
 we entertainers of course the shits affectin our sales 
 you ignoramus but music is reflection of self 
 we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail 
 its fucked up aint it how we can come from practically nothin 
 to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted 
 thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing 
 except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine  
 who post pinup pictures on they walls all day long 
 idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs 
 or for anyone whos ever been through shit in they lives 
 so they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die 
 til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe 
 were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in they eyes 
 thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it 
 squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden 
 and maybe theyll admit it when were gone just let our spirits 
 live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can 
  
 sing with me  sing for the year  
 sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  
 sing it with me its just for today 
 maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away

 little hellions kids feeling rebellious 
 embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis 
 they start feeling like prisoners helpless 
 til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch 
 a visionary vision is scary 
 could start a revolution polluting the airwaves 
 a rebel so just let me revel and bask 
 in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass  
 and its a disaster such a catastrophe 
 for you to see so damn much of my assyou asked for me 
 well im back nananananananananana 
 fix your bent antenna tune it in and then im gonna 
 enter in and up under your skin like a splinter 
 the center of attention back for the winter

 testing attention please

 heres my ten cents my two cents is free 
 a nuisance who sent you sent for me

 ever since prince turned himself into a symbol 
 but sometimes the shit just seems 
 everybody only wants to discuss me 
 so this must mean im disgusting 
 but its just me im just obscene 
 though im not the first king of controversy 
 i am the worst thing since elvis presley 
 to do black music so selfishly 
 and use it to get myself wealthy

 twenty million other white rappers emerge 
 but no matter how many fish in the sea 
 itd be so empty without me

 kids	step by step heart to heart 
 left right left we all fall down 
  
  
 step by step heart to heart 
 left right left we all fall down 
 step by step heart to heart 
 left right left we all fall down 
 like toy soldiers 
 bit by bit torn apart 
 we never win but the battle wages on 
 for toy soldiers 
  
  
 im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure 
 even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders 
 i aint never supposed to show it 
 my crew aint supposed to know it 
 even if it means goin toetotoe with a benzino 
 it dont matter i never drag em in battles that i cant handle 
 less i absolutely have to im supposed to set an example 
 i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em 
 if some shit ever does pop off im supposed to be beside em 
 that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it 
 theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it 
 i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it 
 it was crazy the shit went way beyond some jayz and nas shit 
 and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it 
 i spent so much energy on it honestly im exhausted 
 and im so caught in it that i almost feel im the one who caused it 
 this aint what im in hiphop for thats not why i got in it 
 that was never my object for someone to get killed 
 why would i wanna destroy something i helped build 
 that wasnt my intentions my intentions were good 
 i went through my whole career without ever mentionin  
 and that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth 
 and talkin about somethin that i knew nothin about 
 plus dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef 
 so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth 
 while hes all over tv downtalkin the man 
 who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand 
 this is business and this shit just isnt none of my business 
 but still knowin the shit could pop off at any minute cause 
  
 step by step heart to heart 
 left right left we all fall down 
 like toy soldiers 
 bit by bit torn apart 
 we never win but the battle wages on 
 for toy soldiers 
  
  
 there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and 
 wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin 
 but now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it 
 the shit gets escalatedit aint just words no more is it 
 its a different ballgame you call names and you aint just rappin 
 we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin 
 me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him 
 and asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him 
 until ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him 
 fuck it 50 smash him mash on him let him have it 
 meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction 
 some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk 
 has an erection for me and thinks that ill be his resurrection 
 tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
 but now hes fucked the game up 
 cause one of the ways i came up 
 was through that publication the same one that made me famous 
 now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
 well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then 
 but im so busy bein pissed off i dont stop to think 
 that we just inherited 50s beef with murder inc 
 and hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind 
 but we still have soldiers thats on the front line 
 whos willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders 
 never to extort us strictly to show they support us 
 and maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus 
 to show em we love em back and let em know how important 
 it is to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners 
 their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is 
 but i aint tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered 
 it aint worth it i cant think of a perfecter way to word it 
 than to just say that i love yall too much to see the verdict 
 ill walk away from it all fore i let it go any further 
 but dont get it twisted its not a plea that im coppin 
 im just willin to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin 
 off at the jaws well then i can cause frankly im sick of talkin 
 im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience 
 cause 
  
 step by step heart to heart 
 left right left we all fall down 
 like toy soldiers 
 bit by bit torn apart 
 we never win but the battle wages on 
 for toy soldiers	may i have your attention please 
 may i have your attention please 
 will the real slim shady please stand up 
 i repeat will the real slim shady please stand up

 sometimes i wanna get on tv and just let loose 
 but cant but its cool for tom green to hump a dead moose 
 my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips 
 and if im lucky you might just give it a little kiss 
 and thats the message that we deliver to little kids 
 and expect them not to know what a womans clitoris is 
 of course theyre gonna know what intercourse is 
 by the time they hit fourth grade 
 theyve got the discovery channel dont they 
 we aint nothin but mammalswell some of us cannibals 
 who cut other people open like cantaloupes 
 but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes 
 then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope 
 but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote 
 women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes

 either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block 
 and your mom was savin money for you in a jar 
 tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college 
 almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it 
 and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart 
 and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart 
 mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back 
 on to chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment 
 and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara 
 and thats when daddy went to california with his cd 
 and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me 
 but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me 
 then you started seein daddy on the tv and momma didnt like it 
 and you and lainie were too young to understand it 
 papa was a rolling stone momma developed a habit 
 and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it 
 im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 
 cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud

  im a criminal	motherfuckers say that im foolish i only talk about jewels  
 do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it 
 see im influenced by the ghetto you ruined 
 the same dude you gave nothin i made somethin doin 
 what i do through and through and 
 i give you the news with a twist its just his ghetto point of view 
 the renegade you been afraid i penetrate pop culture 
 bring em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters 
 and they live with they moms got dropped roadsters 
 from botched robberies niggas crouched over 
 mamis knocked up cause she wasnt watched over 
 knocked down by some clown when child support knocked 
 no hes not around now how that sound to ya jot it down 
 i bring you through the ghetto without ridin round 
 hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways 
 just read a magazine that fucked up my day 
 how you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it 
 i help them see they way through itnot you 
 cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes 
 bet everything you worth youll lose your tie and your shirt 
  
  
 since im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen 
 i aint no politician but ill kick it with em a minute 
 cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits ill wear it 
 but if it dont then yall will swallow the truth grin and bear it 
 now whos the king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics 
 who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics 
 usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits 
 but theres a huge interference theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it 
 maybe its hatred i spew maybe its food for the spirit 
 maybe its beautiful music i made for you to just cherish 
 but im debated disputed hated and viewed in america 
 as a motherfuckin drug addict like you didnt experiment 
 nah nahthats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror 
 and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrassed 
 and i got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents 
 you fuckin dogooders too bad you couldnt do good at marriage  
 and do you have any clue what i had to do to get here 
 i dont think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo 
 cause here we go hes jiggajurjiggajihjigga

 pockets filled with a lotta lint not a cent

 by the bodega iron under my coat 
 feelin braver durag wrappin my waves up pockets full of hope 
 do not step to me im awkward i box lefty 
 an orphan my pops left me and often my momma wasnt home 
 could not stress to me i wasnt grown 
 specially on nights i brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings 
 my demeanor thirty years my senior 
 my childhood didnt mean much only raisin green up 
 raisin my fingers to critics raisin my head to the sky 
 big i did it multi before i die 
 no lie just know i chose my own fate 
 i drove by the fork in the road and went straight 
  
 see im a poet to some a regular modernday shakespeare 
 jesus christ the king of these latterday saints here 
 to shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as 
 a monger of hate satanist scatterbrained atheist 
 but that aint the case see its a matter of taste 
 we as a people decide if shadys as bad as they say he is 
 or is he the latter a gateway to escape 
 media scapegoat who they can be mad at today 
 see its as easy as cake simple as whistlin dixie 
 while im wavin the pistol at sixty christians against me 
 go to war with the mormons take a bath with the catholics 
 in holy water no wonder they tried to hold me under longer 
 im a motherfuckin spiteful delightful eyeful

 detroit	theres not much you could do or say to phase me 
 people think im a little bit crazy 
 i get it from all angles even occasionally doc drezie 
 will have to step in every once in a while to save me 
 to make me stop and think about it fore i just say things 
 sometimes i forget what other people just may think 
 a lot of rappers probably wouldnt know how to take me 
 if they heard some shit id lay the tape fore they erased me 
 i may be a little too fastpaced and racy 
 sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me 
 twenty times cause i say so many rhymes it may seem 
 like im goin too fast cause my mind is racing 
 and i could give a fuck what category you place me 
 long as when im pushing up daisies 
 and gone as long as you place me amongst one of them greats 
 when i hit the heavenly gates ill be cool beside jayz 
 for every single diehard fan who embraced me 
 im thankful for the talent in which god gave me 
 and im thankful for the environment that he placed me 
 believe it or not i thank my mom for how she raised me 
 in the neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me 
 it only made me what i am today see 
 regardless of what anybody believes who hates me 
 you aint gonna make or break me 
 tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake g 
 youre only gonna be in for a rude awakening 
 cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me 
 and when you face me with all the shit youve been saving 
 to say to me you had all this time to think about it 
 now dont pussy out and try to about face me 
 cause ive been patiently waiting for the day 
 that we finally meet in the same place to see

 no matter how many emcees i eat up 
 oh oh its never enough	what we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough if you will to be saved not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls  their throwaway children 
 we seem to be approaching  an age of the gross  
 we all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents station and eachand each generation should do a little bit better 
  
  
 all right come on lets cut the bullshit enough 
 lets get it started lets start addressin this issue and open it up 
 lets take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss 
 statements thats made on this tape and its whole origin of 
 the music that we all know and love the music we all enjoy 
 the music you accuse me of tryin to destroy 
 lets rewind it to 89 when i was a boy 
 on the east side of detroit crossin 8 mile into warren 
 into hick territory id like to share a story 
 this is my story and cant nobody tell it for me 
 you have well informed me i am wellaware 
 that i dont belong here youve made that perfectly clear 
 i get my ass kicked damn near everywhere 
 from belaire shopping center just for stoppin in there 
 from the black side all the way to the white side 
 okay theres a bright side a day that i might slide

 id roam the streets so much they called me a drifter 
 sometimes id stick up a thumb just to hitchhike 
 just to get picked up to get me a lift to 
 8 mile and van dyke or steal a goddamn bike 
 from somebodys backyard and drop it off at the park 
 that was the halfway mark to meet kim had to walk 
 back to her mamas on chalmers after dark 
 to sneak me in the house when im kicked out my moms 
 thats about the time i first met proof 
 with goofy gary on the steps at osborn handin out some flyers 
 we was doin some talent shows at center line high 
 i told him to stop by and check us out sometime 
 he looked at me like im out my mind 
 shook his head like white boys dont know how to rhyme 
 i spit out a line and rhymed birthday with first place 
 and we both had the same rhymes that sound alike 
 we was on the same shit that big daddy kane shit 
 where compound syllables sound combined 
 from that day we was down to ride 
 somehow we knew wed meet again somewhere down the line

 it was cool til your man mc shan came through 
 he said that pumas the brand cause the klan makes troops 
 it was rumors but man goddamn they flew 
 musta been true because man we done banned they shoes 
 i had the new ones the cool j ice lamb suede too 
 but we just threw em in the trash like they yesterdays news

 and we aint know what it meant me and my man howard 
 and butter would go to the mall

 you aint even half black 
 you aint posed to have that homie let me grab that 
 and that flavor flav clock we gon have to snatch that

 manixs basement sayin how we hate this 
 how racist but dope the x clans tape is 
 which reminds me back in 89 me 
 and kim broke up for the first time she was tryin to twotime me 
 and there was this black girl at our school who thought i was cool 
 cause i rapped so she was kinda eyein me 
 and oh the irony guess what her name was 
 aint even gonna say it plus 
 the same color hair as hers was and blue contacts 
 and a pair of jugs the bombest goddamn girl in our whole school 
 if i could pull her not only would i become more popular 
 but i would be able to piss kim off at the same time 
 but it backfired 
 i was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy 
 and thats the last i ever seen or heard 
 or spoke to the ole foolish pride girl but ive heard 
 people say they heard the tape and it aint that bad 
 but it was i singled out a whole race 
 and for that i apologize i was wrong 
 cause no matter what color a girl is shes still a

 fuck out of my house you fuckin pieces of shit 
 get the fuck out of my house you stupid fucker 
 you son of a bitch	step by step heart to heart 
 left right left we all fall down 
  
  
 step by step heart to heart 
 left right left we all fall down 
 step by step heart to heart 
 left right left we all fall down 
 like toy soldiers 
 bit by bit torn apart 
 we never win but the battle wages on 
 for toy soldiers 
  
  
 im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure 
 even though i hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders 
 i aint never supposed to show it 
 my crew aint supposed to know it 
 even if it means goin toetotoe with a benzino 
 it dont matter i never drag em in battles that i cant handle 
 less i absolutely have to im supposed to set an example 
 i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em 
 if some shit ever does pop off im supposed to be beside em 
 that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it 
 theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it 
 i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it 
 it was crazy the shit went way beyond some jayz and nas shit 
 and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it 
 i spent so much energy on it honestly im exhausted 
 and im so caught in it that i almost feel im the one who caused it 
 this aint what im in hiphop for thats not why i got in it 
 that was never my object for someone to get killed 
 why would i wanna destroy something i helped build 
 that wasnt my intentions my intentions were good 
 i went through my whole career without ever mentionin  
 and that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth 
 and talkin about somethin that i knew nothin about 
 plus dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef 
 so i did i just fell back watched and gritted my teeth 
 while hes all over tv downtalkin the man 
 who literally saved my life like fuck it i understand 
 this is business and this shit just isnt none of my business 
 but still knowin the shit could pop off at any minute cause 
  
 step by step heart to heart 
 left right left we all fall down 
 like toy soldiers 
 bit by bit torn apart 
 we never win but the battle wages on 
 for toy soldiers 
  
  
 there used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and 
 wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin 
 but now its elevated cause once you put someones kids in it 
 the shit gets escalatedit aint just words no more is it 
 its a different ballgame you call names and you aint just rappin 
 we actually tried to stop the 50 and ja beef from happenin 
 me and dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him 
 and asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him 
 until ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him 
 fuck it 50 smash him mash on him let him have it 
 meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction 
 some receptionist at the source who answers phones at his desk 
 has an erection for me and thinks that ill be his resurrection 
 tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record 
 but now hes fucked the game up 
 cause one of the ways i came up 
 was through that publication the same one that made me famous 
 now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
 well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then 
 but im so busy bein pissed off i dont stop to think 
 that we just inherited 50s beef with murder inc 
 and hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind 
 but we still have soldiers thats on the front line 
 whos willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders 
 never to extort us strictly to show they support us 
 and maybe shout em out in a rap or up in a chorus 
 to show em we love em back and let em know how important 
 it is to have runyon avenue soldiers up in our corners 
 their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is 
 but i aint tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered 
 it aint worth it i cant think of a perfecter way to word it 
 than to just say that i love yall too much to see the verdict 
 ill walk away from it all fore i let it go any further 
 but dont get it twisted its not a plea that im coppin 
 im just willin to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin 
 off at the jaws well then i can cause frankly im sick of talkin 
 im not gonna let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience 
 cause 
  
 step by step heart to heart 
 left right left we all fall down 
 like toy soldiers 
 bit by bit torn apart 
 we never win but the battle wages on 
 for toy soldiers	eminem pukes into the toilet 
 eminem hocks and spits into the toilet 
 toilet flush 
 there i go thinking of you again 
  
  
 you dont know how sick you make me 
 you make me fucking sick to my stomach 
 every time i think of you i puke 
 you must just not knooooooow 
 you may not think you do but you do 
 every time i think of you i puke 
  
  
 i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem 
 but off of the dome would probably be a little more 
 more suitable for this type of song whoa 
 i got a million reasons off the top of my head that i could think of 
 sixteen bars just aint enough to put some ink to 
 so fuck it ima start right here ill just be brief im 
 bout to rattle off some of the reasons 
 i knew i shouldnt go and get another tattoo 
 of you on my arm but what do i go and do 
 i go and get another one now i got two  
 now im sitting here with your name on my skin 
 i cant believe i went and did this stupid shit again 
 my next girlfriend now her names gotta be kim  
 if you only knew how much i hated you 
 for every motherfucking thing youve ever put us through 
 then i wouldnt be standing here crying over you  
  
 you dont know how sick you make me 
 you make me fucking sick to my stomach 
 every time i think of you i puke 
 you must just not knooooooow 
 you may not think you do but you do 
 every time i think of you i puke 
  
  
 i was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter 
 but i thought a song would probably be a little better 
 instead of a letter that youd probably just shred up yeah 
 i stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of 
 how much of a waste itd be for me to put some ink to a stupid piece of 
 paper id rather let you see how 
 much i fucking hate you in a freestyle 
 youre a fucking cokehead slut i hope you fucking die 
 i hope you get to hell and satan sticks a needle in your eye 
 i hate your fucking guts you fucking slut i hope you die  
 but please dont get me wrong im not bitter or mad 
 its not that i still love you its not cause i want you back 
 its just that when i think of you it makes me wanna yack  
 but what else can i do i havent got a clue 
 now i guess ill just move on i have no choice but to 
 but every time i think of you now all i wanna do is puuuuuuuke 
  
 you dont know how sick you make me 
 you make me fucking sick to my stomach 
 every time i think of you i puke 
 you must just not knooooooow 
 you may not think you do but you do 
 every time i think of you i puke

 um oh yeah anyway somebody told me that um 
 they heard a rumor that you got a new gun 
 um i know its probably not true 
 but i just need to talk to you about that 
 so um gimme a call	yeah 
 definitely definitely 
 definitely dope 
 definitely 
 definitely kmart 
 yeah yeah  
  
  
 you find me offensive 
 i find you offensive for finding me offensive 
 hence if i should draw out or line any fences 
 if so to what extent if any should i go 
 cause its getting expensive 
 being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive 
 they say i cause extensive 
 psychological nerve damage to the brain 
 when i go to lengths this far at other peoples expenses 
 i say youre all just too goddamn sensitive 
 its censorship and its downright blasphemous 
 lets end this shit now cause i wont stand for this 
 and christopher reeves wont sit for this neither 
 and lets clear this up too i aint got no beef with him either 
 he used to be like a hero to me i even believe i 
 had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator 
 right next to darth vader 
 and darth mustve put a hex on him for later 
 i feel like its my fault cause of the way that 
 i stuck him up in between him and lex luthor 
 i killed superman i killed superman 
 and how ironic 
 that id be the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic 
  
 cause i aint got no legs 
 or no brain 
 nice to meet you 
 hi my name is 
 i forgot my name 
 my aim was not to become what i became 
 with this level of fame 
 my soul is possessed by this devil 
 my new name is rain man 
  
  
 now in the bible it says 
 thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed 
 have homosexual sex 
 unless of course you were given the consent to join in 
 then of course its intercourse and its bisexual sex 
 which isnt as bad 
 long as you show some remorse for your actions 
 either before during or after 
 performing the act of that which 
 is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases 
 that are more used by todays kids in a more derogatory way 
 but whos to say whats fair to say and what not to say 
 lets ask dr dre 
 dr dre  i got a question if i may  
 is it gay to play puttputt golf with a friend  
 and watch his butt butt when he tees off  
 but but i aint done yet 
 in football the quarterback yells out huthut 
 while he reaches in another grown mans ass 
 grabs on his nuts but just what if 
 it was never meant it was just an accident 
 but he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in 
 his teeny tiny little round hiney and he didnt mean it 
 but his little weenie flinched just a little bit 
 and i dont need to go into any more details but 
 what if he pictured it as a females butt 
 is that gay i just need to clear things up 
 til then ill just walk around with a manly strut because 
  
 cause i aint got no legs 
 or no brain 
 nice to meet you 
 hi my name is 
 i forgot my name 
 my aim was not to become what i became 
 with this level of fame 
 my soul is possessed by this devil 
 my new name is rain man 
  
  
 you find me offensive i find you offensive 
 shit this is the same verse i just did this 
 when am i gonna come to my good senses 
 probably the day bush comes to my defenses 
 my spider sense is telling me spiderman is nearby 
 and my plan is to get him next 
 and open up a whoop ass canister 
 goddammit dre wheres the goddamn beat  
 anyway anyway i dont know how else to put it 
 this is the only thing that im good at 
 i am the bad guy kryptonite the green chronic 
 demonic yup yup dont worry im on it 
 i got it highfive nick lachey 
 stuck a pin in jessicas head and walked away 
 and as she flew around the room like a balloon i 
 grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can 
 and zoomed i headed straight back to the neverland ranch 
 with a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich 
 and i aint even gotta make no goddamn sense 
 i just did a whole song and i didnt say shit 
  
 cause i aint got no legs 
 or no brain 
 nice to meet you 
 hi my name is 
 i forgot my name 
 my aim was not to become what i became 
 with this level of fame 
 my soul is possessed by this devil 
 my new name is rain man 
  
  
 cause 
 yup rain man

 and if you dont understand dont even bother to ask 
 a father who has grown up with a fatherless past 
 who has blown up now to rap phenomenon that has 
 or at least shows no difficulty multitaskin 
 and juggling both perhaps mastered his craft slash 
 entrepreneur whos helped launch a few more rap acts 
 whos had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half 
 of his career typical manure movin past that

 now this is our final hour 
 let me be the voice and your strength and your choice 
 let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise 
 try to amplify it times it and multiply it by six 
 teen million people all equal at this high pitch 
 maybe we can reach alqaeda through my speech 
 let the president answer a higher anarchy 
 strap him with an ak47 let him go 
 fight his own war let him impress daddy that way 
 no more blood for oil 
 we got our own battles to fight on our own soil 
 no more psychological warfare 
 to trick us to thinkin that we aint loyal 
 if we dont serve our own country were patronizin a hero 
 look in his eyes its all lies 
 the stars and stripes have been swiped washed out and wiped 
 and replaced with his own face mosh now or die

 we gon mosh through the marsh take us right through the doors come on 
  
  
 and as we proceed 
 to mosh through this desert storm 
 and these closing statements 
 if they should argue let us beg to differ 
 as we set aside our differences 
 and assemble our own army 
 to disarm this weapon of mass destruction 
 that we call our president for the present 
 and mosh for the future of our next generation 
 to speak and be heard 
 mr president mr senator 
 can you guys hear us	i dont understand 
 why are you being so mean 
 youre a mean mean man 
  
  
 youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do 
 so instead of just admitting it you walk around and say 
 all kinds of really mean things about me 
 cause youre a meanie a meanie 
 but its only cause youre just really jealous of me 
 cause im what you wanna be so you just look like an idiot 
 when you say these mean things cause its too easy to see 
 youre really just a big weenie big weenie 
  
  
 alright listen i need you to focus 
 i need you to go dig deep in your mind this is important 
 we are going to perform an experiment of the sorts 
 im going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment 
 now i need you to open your mind your eyes close em 
 you are now about to be placed under my hypnosis 
 for the next four and a half minutes we are going to explore 
 into your mind to find out why youre so fucking jealous 
 now why did they make yoohoo pippitykakapoopoo 
 psych im kidding i just wanted to see if youre still listening 
 okay now i need your undivided attention 
 sir i have a question why do i always sense this undeniable tension 
 from the moment that i enter into the room it gets all quiet and whispers 
 whenever theres conversation why am i always mentioned 
 ive been dying to ask its been itching at me is it just because 
  
 youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do 
 so instead of just admitting it you walk around and say 
 all kinds of really mean things about me 
 cause youre a meanie a meanie 
 but its only cause youre just really jealous of me 
 cause im what you wanna be so you just look like an idiot 
 when you say these mean things cause its too easy to see 
 youre really just a big weenie big weenie 
  
  
 alright now i  i just flubbed a line 
 i was going to say something extremely important 
 but i forgot who or what it was i fucked up 
 psych im kidding again you idiot no i didnt 
 thats just what you wanted to hear from me is that i fucked up aint it 
 but i can bust one take without looking at no paper 
 it doesnt take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day 
 for me to say the truth okay youre drooling you have tooth decay 
 your mouth is open youre disgusting what the fuck you eat for lunch 
 a bunch of sweets or something what you munch a bunch of crunch n munch 
 your tooth is rotten to the gum your breath stinks wanna chew some gum 
 yes i do sir what am i on you sir are on truth serum 
 marshall im so jealous of you please say you wont tell nobody 
 id be so embarrassed im just absolutely terrified 
 that someones gonna find out why im saying all these terrible 
 evil and awful mean things its my own insecurities 
  
 youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do 
 so instead of just admitting it you walk around and say 
 all kinds of really mean things about me 
 cause youre a meanie a meanie 
 but its only cause youre just really jealous of me 
 cause im what you wanna be so you just look like an idiot 
 when you say these mean things cause its too easy to see 
 youre really just a big weenie big weenie 
  
  
 alright now we were going to conduct 
 that experiment that we were talking about earlier 
 just to see what a frog looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy 
 cause thats exactly what your eyes look like wanna check to see 
 heres a mirror notice the resemblance here 
 wait let me put these sunglasses on now look in this mirror 
 how bout now what do you have in common 
 youre both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on em 
 you look like i sound like singing about weenies 
 now take my weenie out of your mouth 
 this is between me and you i know youre not happy 
 i know youd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying 
 curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying theres no denying 
 that my weenie is much bigger than yours is 
 mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges 
 why are you even doing this to yourself its pointless 
 why do we have to keep on going through this this is torturous 
 my point is this 
 that if you say mean things your weenie will shrink 
 now i forgot what the chorus is youre just as 
  
 youre just jealous of me cause you you just cant do what i do 
 so instead of just admitting it you walk around and say 
 all kinds of really mean things about me 
 cause youre a meanie a meanie 
 but its only cause youre just really jealous of me 
 cause im what you wanna be so you just look like an idiot 
 when you say these mean things cause its too easy to see 
 youre really just a big weenie big weenie 
  
  
 fuck off my dick	ayo paul its em 
 i got your call about the michael jackson thing 
 and i know that hes not thrilled about the video 
 what does he wanna be startin somethin 
 wow well ill show him whos really bad burps 
 paul the way you make me feel with these calls 
 you should really take a look at the man in the mirror 
 and tell him to beat it because i wont stop til i get enough 
 do you remember the time 
 we were watching the billie jean video 
 well hell always be that michael to me 
 and it doesnt matter if hes black or white 
 because i cant stop loving him 
 and i hate plastic surgeons and i hope they all fucking die 
 how do you like that and i like him i like him a lot 
 i wanna touch him but i cant mouth noises 
 excuse me im taking a shit sorry 
 anyways call me back 
 i have this idea about how i want to end the show 
 so hit me when you get this message fucker 
 oh and by the way no i dont have a new gun 
 gun cracks and bullets fall out god damn it	if theres any bitches in this room 
 then theres somethin i gotta say 
 for all the fools who fell for the first girl who comes their way 
 ive been down that road 
 and now im back sittin on square one 
 tryin to pick myself up where i started from 
  
  
 i never woulda thought that id see you out of control 
 even though my penis was deep down in your hole 
 you should know between us we was like mates of soul 
 nothin could intervene us especially no hoes 
 you was more so the chalant type i chose 
 til more shows haunted you nights i suppose 
 thats how it go with time spent emotion grows 
 in the beginning friends we decided to roll 
 so whos responsible when you get excited explode 
 and obies grinnin then you invite that obies cold 
 but bitches they gon talk niggas they gon hate 
 we established this way before we became mates 
 so whats required is that you chill with all that fire 
 get your desire when i retire and 
  
  
 spend some time with me say that youll be mine  
 i never thought id find someone to be mine 
 lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line 
 spend some time with me say that youll be mine 
  
 i used to say i never met a girl like you before 
 still aint got a fuckin clue as to who you truly are 
 almost went as far as introducin you to my daughters 
 til you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers 
 now i just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for 
 cant believe i almost flew the coop for some stupid whore 
 you used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours 
 all i ever wanted from you was a few booty calls 
 if you recall i used to treat you like a groupie broad 
 when we fucked i refused to even take my jewelry off 
 but it threw me off the first time i called and you blew me off 
 it was a shock it struck me as odd but it turned me on 
 you started gettin moody on me pretty soon wed argue 
 and the ruder you got the more beautiful you got to me 
 and whoda even knew that who woulda even thought possibly 
 cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me 
 its true that i got shot in the heart 
 but when someone seems too good to be true they usually are 
 but see when youre in it its too hard to see 
 til you pull up and see some other dudes car parked and reach 
 up under the seat as your heart starts to beat 
 before you make a decision thats lifealtering 
 and just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave 
 you hear them words echoing almost haunting that taunting ring 
  
 spend some time with me say that youll be mine  
 i never thought id find someone to be mine 
 lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line 
 spend some time with me say that youll be mine  
  
  
 ha ha yeah right bitch 
 spend some time on my dick 
  
  
 in most cases stats attitude is fuck a bitch 
 my only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch 
 but you was different thought we shared a covenant 
 even held your hand in pubalic 
 we sufferin because of this 
 shawty on some whole nother other shit 
 tryin to play slick thinkin ima trick off grip 
 ill admit i was caught in the mix down to commit 
 feedin you the best of me i shouldve fed you piss 
 we started off closer than close 
 but who couldve predicted to know 
 your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth 
 and the final result back in that same boat 
 i asked myself do i love these hoes  nope 
  
  em introduced us 50 this is tanya tanya this is 50 
 then slid off and left her to kick it with me 
 i complimented her i said you have very nice lips 
 with my imagination i could see her suckin my dick 
 we played the phone game a week later shit changed fast 
 had her comin over in a cab to give me some ass 
 downtown manhattan on the balcony stare at the skyline 
 penthouse full of imported shit you know how i grind 
 she got to talkin talkin like an opportunist too 
 why talk when suckin my dick is the real career move 
 said shes an aspiring actress she do videos for practice 
 yeah yeah know how many times i done heard that shit  
  
  
 spend some time with me say that youll be mine 
 i never thought id find someone to be mine 
 lord knows i was right cause you just crossed the line 
 spend some time with me say that youll be mine	yeah i know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now but hey whatd daddy always tell you straighten up little soldier stiffen up that upper lip what you cryin about you got me 
  
  
 hailie i know you miss your mom and i know you miss your dad 
 when im gone but im tryin to give you the life that i never had 
 i can see youre sad even when you smile even when you laugh 
 i can see it in your eyes deep inside you wanna cry 
 cause youre scared i aint there 
 daddys with you in your prayers 
 no more cryin wipe them tears 
 daddys here no more nightmares 
 we gon pull together through it 
 we gon do it lainieuncles crazy aint he 
 yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it 
 were all we got in this world when it spins when it swirls 
 when it whirls when it twirls two little beautiful girls 
 lookin puzzled in a daze i know its confusin you 
 daddys always on the move mommas always on the news 
 i try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems 
 the harder that i try to do that the more it backfires on me 
 all the things growin up as daddy that he had to see 
 daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did 
 we did not plan it to be this way your mother and me 
 but things have got so bad between us i dont see us ever bein 
 together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers 
 but then of course everything always happens for a reason 
 i guess it was never meant to be but its just something 
 we have no control over and thats what destiny is 
 but no more worries rest your head and go to sleep 
 maybe one day well wake up and thisll all just be a dream 
  
 now hush little baby dont you cry 
 everythings gonna be alright 
 stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya 
 daddys here to hold ya through the night 
 i know mommys not here right now and we dont know why 
 we fear how we feel inside 
 it may seem a little crazy pretty baby 
 but i promise mommas gon be alright  
  
  
 its funny i remember back one year when daddy had no money 
 mommy wrapped the christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree 
 and said some of em were from me cause daddy couldnt buy em 
 ill never forget that christmas i sat up the whole night cryin 
 cause daddy felt like a bumsee daddy had a job 
 but his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom 
 and at the time every house that we lived in 
 either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block 
 and your mom was savin money for you in a jar 
 tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college 
 almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it 
 and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart 
 and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart 
 mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back 
 on to chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment 
 and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara 
 and thats when daddy went to california with his cd 
 and met dr dre and flew you and momma out to see me 
 but daddy had to work you and momma had to leave me 
 then you started seein daddy on the tv and momma didnt like it 
 and you and lainie were too young to understand it 
 papa was a rolling stone momma developed a habit 
 and it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it 
 im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 
 cause all i ever wanted to do was just make you proud 
 now im sittin in this empty house 
 just reminiscin lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out 
 to see how much you both have grown its almost like youre sisters now 
 wow guess you pretty much are and daddys still here 
 lainie im talkin to you too daddys still here 
 i like the sound of that yeah its got a ring to it dont it 
 sshh mommas only gone for the moment 
  
 now hush little baby dont you cry 
 everythings gonna be alright 
 stiffen that upper lip up little lady i told ya 
 daddys here to hold ya through the night 
 i know mommys not here right now and we dont know why 
 we fear how we feel inside 
 it may seem a little crazy pretty baby 
 but i promise mommas gon be alright 
  
  
 and if you ask me to daddys gonna buy you a mockingbird 
 ima give you the world 
 ima buy a diamond ring for you ima sing for you 
 ill do anything for you to see you smile 
 and if that mockingbird dont sing and that ring dont shine 
 ima break that birdies neck 
 ill go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya 
 and make him eat every carat dont fuck with dad	tell myself that i was doing alright 
 theres nothing left to do tonight 
 but go crazy on you 
 crazy on you 
 let me go crazy crazy on you 
  
  
 cant you see what you do to me baby 
 you make me crazy you make me act like a maniac 
 im like a lunatic you make me sick 
 youre truly the only one who can do this to me 
 you just make me get so crazy 
 i go schizo i get so insane i just go schizophrenic 
 one minute i wanna slit your throat the next i wanna sex 
 you make me crazy the way we act 
 like two maniacs in the sack 
 we fuck like two jackrabbits 
 and maybe thats a bad habit 
 cause the next day were right back at it 
 in the same exact pattern 
 what the fuck is the matter with us 
 we cant figure out if its lust or its love 
 whats that thats attractin us to each other 
 they say that every man grows up to marry his own mother 
 which would explain why youre such a motherfuckin bitch 
 but i stay and still stick it out with you 
 even though i just hit you today 
 but you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you 
 just cause i came home late last night 
 crawled in bed and i woke you 
 but if theres one thing about you that i admire its baby 
 because you stay with me maybe cause youre as crazy as i am 
 cause when i look at you i can see an angel in your eyes 
 but if i look deeper inside i see your freakish little side 
 like a devil in disguise youre always full of surprises 
 always pullin devices out your purse little vibrators and dildoes 
 you fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore 
 youre only 24 but youre plenty more mature 
 than those other little hoes who just act like little girls 
 like theyre in middle school still 
 youre crazy sexy cool chill 
 and you play your position you never step outta line 
 even though i stay in your business youve always kept outta mine 
 i wonder whats on your mind 
 sometimes they say love is blind 
 maybe thats why the first time 
 i dotted your eye you aint see the sign 
 or maybe you did maybe you like being shoved 
 maybe cause were crazy in love 
  
 go crazy on you 
 crazy on you 
 let me go crazy crazy on you 
  
  
 you are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad 
 the moral the very fiber the whole substance to my rap 
 you are my reason for being the meaning of my existence 
 if it wasnt for you i would never be able to spit this 
 as intense as i do and the irony is you rely on me 
 as much as i rely on you to inspire me like you do 
 you provide me the lighter fluid the fuel to my fire 
 youre my entire supply gas the match and igniter 
 the only way that i am able to stay so stable 
 is youre the legs to my table 
 if you were to break id fall on my face 
 but im always gonna make you feel i dont need you as much 
 as i really need you so you dont use it to your advantage 
 but youre essential to me youre the air i breathe i believe 
 if you ever leave me id probably have no reason to be 
 you are the kim to my marshall youre the slim to my shady 
 the dre to my eminem the alaina to my hailie 
 you are the word that im lookin for 
 when im tryin to describe how i feel inside 
 and the right one just wont come to my mind 
 youre like the pillar that props me up the beam that supports me 
 the bitch who never took half the wife who never divorced me 
 youre like the root to my evil you let my devil come out me 
 you let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me 
 and no matter how much too much is never enough 
 maybe cause were crazy in love 
  
 go crazy on you 
 crazy on you 
 let me go crazy crazy on you	gunshots and crowd hollering

 there aint nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cause 
  
 the more you put me through 
 the more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 you say you hate me i just love you more 
 you dont want me i just want you more 
 i buy you flowers you throw em at me 
 i know its sad but its makin me happy 
 the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 
 cause you love me and i love you more 
  
  
 cause i hate you do you hate me 
 good cause youre so fuckin beautiful when youre angry 
 it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you 
 on the bed and fuck you like i dont even know you 
 you fuck other people and i fuck other people 
 youre a slut but im equal im a mutt were both evil 
 in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it 
 cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it 
 we can make accusations people spread rumors 
 but they aint got proof til they do its just the two of us 
 its you and me cause any chick can say that she screwin me 
 but you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed 
 if you didnt i wouldnt be hittin  yeah i would 
 cause the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to 
 that would be this soft and warm 
 so its off and on usually more off than on 
 but at least we know that we share this common bond 
 youre the only one i can fuck without a condom on 
 i hope the only reason that i cope is cause of that fact 
 and plus i can bust in that and thats why 
  
 the more you put me through 
 the more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 you say you hate me i just love you more 
 you dont want me i just want you more 
 i buy you flowers you throw em at me 
 i know its sad but its makin me happy 
 the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 
 cause you love me and i love you more 
  
  
 i can never understand it thats why i dont try 
 from junior high until we both die its silly 
 oh why must we try is it really so rough 
 that we must always call each others billy goats gruff 
 try to pull each others legs until the other begs 
 were lyin to ourselves thats the beauty of it yeah 
 cause we truly love each other thats why we always fightin 
 all we do is shove each other every other fuckin night 
 and its clear it aint gonna change its pentup rage 
 we both had we both feel like weve been upstaged 
 by someone else weve both been someone elses 
 someone else problem is neither one wants help 
 its an addiction and it cant be fixed 
 our familys mixed up theres a baby sister in the mix 
 and it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle dont fit 
 and anybody who thinks they know us doesnt know shit 
 and theyre probably just tired of hearin it all the time 
 on every song every lyric and every rhyme 
 all the hoopla all of the whooptywoo 
 what you put me through fuckin whooptydo 
 but i wont be made a fool of if this is true love 
 you wouldnt do what you did last time you wouldnt screw up 
 this time cause this time girl im tellin you what 
 you do it again im fuckin you up 
  
 no matter what you say or what you do 
 ima hunt you down til i find you 
 no matter where you run ill be right there 
 right behind you in your nightmares 
 so i brought you the flowers and the candy 
 all the times that you threw it back at me 
 told me you hate me you gon hate me more 
 when you find out you cant escape me whore 
  
  
 the more you put me through 
 the more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 you say you hate me i just love you more 
 you dont want me i just want you more 
 i buy you flowers you throw em at me 
 i know its sad but its makin me happy 
 the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 
 cause you love me and i love you more	once you call my name out things will never be the same 
 they shouldve never let us get our foot in this game 
  
  
 ever since i was introduced to rap music 
 i been missing a screw like bishop in juice i could lose it 
 at any moment those who know me know it 
 so they probably told to go with the flow just so that 
 i dont explode and have another episode 
 where i let it go as far as the one with benzino did 
 im waiting for that next beef im cocked locked and loaded 
 im ready to go so bad 
 im going bananas my dicks so hard anna 
 nicole could use it to fucking pole vault with 
 oh shit i mean when she was still bloated 
 before they cut her stomach open and lypod it  
 anybody i throw flames at gets a name 
 its a game cause they know that they dont spit the same 
 its a shame what people do for 10 minutes of fame 
 every day its the same thing people in this game 
 try to buddybuddy us 
 just to get close enough to study us everybody just wants 
 to have something to do with that 
 they all trying to get that stamp they after that shadyaftermath money 
 its like a monopoly 
 they probably just now finally understand how to rob fully 
 50 cent was like a fucking jackpot for me 
 and dre its like we hit the fucking lottery 
 and the damn slot machine at the same time as each other 
 why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers 
 when we rhyme with each other in time we discovered 
 that we had more in common than we thought with each other 
 both robbed of our mothers our fathers aint want us 
 what was wrong with us was it our fault 
 cause we started thinking god doesnt love us 
 two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time 
 what a coincidence cause when 50 got shot up in jamaica 
 queens i still remember the call up at chung king cause 
 big l had just got popped just a month before 
 if 50 lives hes getting dropped from columbia 
 two years later me and doc had to come and uhh 
 operate thats when he popped up at number one 
 and we aint never gonna stop if you wondering 
 even if im under the gun 
 you aint got to agree all the time with me or see eyetoeye 
 therell always be animosity between you and i 
 but see the difference is if it is i could give a shit 
 im still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual

 matter fact keep em on 50 
 we call it even ha	these ideas are nightmares to white parents 
 whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings 
 like whatever they say has no bearing 
 its so scary in a house that allows no swearing 
 to see him walkin around with his headphones blarin 
 alone in his own zone cold and he dont care hes 
 a problem child and what bothers him all comes out 
 when he talks about his fuckin dad walkin out  
 cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out 
 if he ever saw him again hed probably knock him out 
 his thoughts are wacked hes mad so hes talkin back 
 talkin black brainwashed from rock and rap 
 he sags his pants dorags and a stockin cap 
 his stepfather hit him so he socked him back 
 and broke his nose his house is a broken home 
 theres no control he just lets his emotions go 
  
  
  sing with me  sing for the year  
 sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  
 sing it with me its just for today 
 maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away 
  
  
 entertainment is changin intertwinin with gangsters 
 in the land of the killers a sinners mind is a sanctum 
 holy or unholy only have one homie 
 only this gun lonely cause dont anyone know me 
 yet everybody just feels like they can relate  
 i guess words are a motherfucker they can be great 
 or they can degrade or even worse they can teach hate 
 its like these kids hang on every single statement we make 
 like they worship us plus all the stores ship us platinum 
 now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen 
 from standin on corners and porches just rappin 
 to havin a fortune no more kissin ass 
 but then these critics crucify you  journalists try to burn you 
 fans turn on you attorneys all want a turn at you 
 to get they hands on every dime you have 
 they want you to lose your mind every time you mad 
 so they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon 
 any dispute wont hesitate to produce handguns 
 thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me 
 strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly 
 but all they kids be listenin to me religiously 
 so im signin cds while police fingerprint me 
 theyre for the judges daughter but his grudge is against me 
 if im such a fuckin menace this shit doesnt make sense b 
 its all political if my music is literal 
 and im a criminal how the fuck can i raise a little girl 
 i couldnt i wouldnt be fit to 
 youre full of shit too guerrera that was a fist that hit you  
  
  sing with me  sing for the year  
 sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  
 sing it with me its just for today 
 maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away 
  
  
 they say music can alter moods and talk to you 
 well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too 
 well if it can then the next time you assault a dude 
 just tell the judge it was my fault and ill get sued 
 see what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols 
 and they wanna get one cause they think the shits cool 
 not knowin we really just protectin ourselves 
 we entertainers of course the shits affectin our sales 
 you ignoramus but music is reflection of self 
 we just explain it and then we get our checks in the mail 
 its fucked up aint it how we can come from practically nothin 
 to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted 
 thats why we sing for these kids who dont have a thing 
 except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine  
 who post pinup pictures on they walls all day long 
 idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs 
 or for anyone whos ever been through shit in they lives 
 so they sit and they cry at night wishin theyd die 
 til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe 
 were nothin to you but were the fuckin shit in they eyes 
 thats why we seize the moment try to freeze it and own it 
 squeeze it and hold it cause we consider these minutes golden 
 and maybe theyll admit it when were gone just let our spirits 
 live on through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can 
  
 sing with me  sing for the year  
 sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  
 sing it with me its just for today 
 maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away 
  
  
 sing with me  sing for the year  
 sing for the laughter and sing for the tear  
 sing it with me its just for today 
 maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away	some days i just wanna up and call it quits 
 i feel like im surrounded by a wall of bricks 
 every time i go to get up i just fall in pits 
 my lifes like one great big ball of shit 
 if i could just put it all into all i spit 
 stead of always tryna swallow it 
 instead of starin at this wall and shit 
 while i sit writers block sick of all this shit 
 cant call it shit all i know is im about to hit the wall 
 if i have to see another one of moms alcoholic fits 
 this is it last straw thats all thats it 
 i aint dealin with another fuckin politic

 what you closedminded fucks were too blind to see 
 whoever finds me is gonna get a finders fee 
 out this world aint no one out their mind as me 
 you need peace of mind heres a piece of mine 
 all i needs a line 
 but sometimes i dont always find the words to rhyme 
 to express how im really feelin at that time 
 yeah sometimes sometimes sometimes 
 its just sometimes its always me 
 how dark can these hallways be 
 the clock strikes midnight one two then halfpast three 
 this halfassed rhyme with this halfassed piece 
 of paper  im desperate at my desk 
 if i can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again 
 stuck in a slump cant think of nothin 
 fuck im stumped up oh wait here comes somethin 
  nope its not good enough scribble it out 
 new pad crinkle it up and throw the shit out 
 im fizzlin now thought i figured it out

 fuckin boiling point put some oil in your joints

 to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment 
 would you capture it or just let it slip yo 
  
  
 his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy 
 theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti 
 hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
 to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting 
 what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud 
 he opens his mouth but the words wont come out 
 hes choking how everybodys joking now 
 the clocks run out times up overblaow 
 snap back to reality ope there goes gravity ope 
 there goes rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont 
 give up that easy no he wont have it he knows 
 his whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope 
 he knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows 
 when he goes back to this mobile home thats when its 
 back to the lab again yo this old rap shit he 
 better go capture this moment and hope it dont pass him and 
  
  
 you better lose yourself in the music

 this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo 
 you better lose yourself in the music 
 the moment you own it you better never let it go

 his souls escaping through this hole that is gaping 
 this world is mine for the taking make me king 
 as we move toward a new world order 
 a normal life is boring but superstardoms 
 close to postmortem it only grows harder 
 homie grows hotter he blows its all over 
 these hoes is all on him coasttocoast shows 
 hes known as the globetrotter lonely roads 
 god only knows hes grown farther from home hes no father 
 he goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
 but hold your nose cause here goes the cold water 
 these hoes dont want him no mo hes cold product 
 they moved on to the next schmoe who flows 
 he nosedove and sold nada and so the soap opera 
 is told it unfolds i suppose its old partner 
 but the beat goes on dadadom dadom dahdah dahdah

 i was playin in the beginning the mood all changed 
 ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
 but i kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher 
 best believe somebodys payin the pied piper 
 all the pain inside amplified by the 
 fact that i cant get by with my nineto 
 five and i cant provide the right type of life for my family 
 cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers 
 and theres no movie theres no mekhi phifer this is my life 
 and these times are so hard and its gettin even harder 
 tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter 
 caught up between bein a father and a prima donna 
 baby mama drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna

 to make it work with her at least for hailies sake 
 i maybe made some mistakes

 goin through public housing systems 
 victim of mnchausens syndrome 
 my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasnt 
 til i grew up now i blew up 
 it makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it 
 wasnt it the reason you made that cd for me ma 
 so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma 
 but guess what youre gettin older now 
 and its cold when youre lonely 
 and nathans growin up so quick 
 hes gonna know that youre phony 
 and hailies gettin so big now you should see her shes beautiful 
 but youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral  
 see what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong 
 bitch do your song keep tellin yourself that you was a mom 
 but how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get 
 you selfish bitch i hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit 
 remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me 
 well guess what i am dead dead to you as can be 
  
 im sorry mama 
 i never meant to hurt you 
 i never meant to make you cry 
 but tonight im cleanin out my closet  
 i said im sorry mama 
 i never meant to hurt you 
 i never meant to make you cry 
 but tonight im cleanin out my closet	psst hey listen 
 la la la la la la la la la laaaa 
 i love my job 
 makes me feel like superman 
 la la la la la la la la la laaaa 
 can you fly i can wanna see 
  
  
 im only entertainin you my 
 goal is to stimulate makin you high 
 and take you and i 
 to a place you cant see but i believe you can fly 
 i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin 
 im not your dad not your mom not your guardian 
 just a man whos on the mic 
 so let me entertain you 
  
  
 my lyrical content is constantly under fire 
 no wonder why i constantly bomb back 
 to combat attacks with constant concepts 
 when lyrics are constantly took outta context 
 failure to communicate with congress has 
 been a problem for the longest i guess 
 but maybe one day we can make some progress 
 food for thought see how long it takes to digest 
 feelin good when i should be ashamed 
 shit i really shoulda fell but i stood see i came 
 like a flame in the night 
 like a ghost in the dark 
 theres a ray theres a light 
 theres a hope theres a spark 
 but when planets collide theyll never see eye to eye 
 until they decide to set the differences aside 
 and this is why only one of us will survive 
 so children follow my lead and feel the vibe because 
  
 im only entertainin you my 
 goal is to stimulate makin you high 
 and take you and i 
 to a place you cant see but i believe you can fly 
 i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin 
 im not your dad not your mom not your guardian 
 just a man whos on the mic 
 so let me entertain you 
  
  
 my music can be slightly amusin 
 you shouldnt take lyrics so serious it might be confusin 
 just tryin to separate the truth from entertainment 
 its stupid aint it i get sick of tryin to explain it 
 see i could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond 
 just being a snot pointynosed bleachblond 
 cause i came here to uplift let your woes be gone 
 tell em to get fucked and just mosey on 
 constantly movin constantly usin 
 the constitution as a form of restitution 
 bless the children nothin less than brilliant 
 let me entertain you like robbie williams 
 ill be here when yall are gone rebuildin 
 world revolvin still evolvin still slim 
 how many kids will copy probly millions 
 but ima do this as a fuckin hobby till then cause 
  
 im only entertainin you my 
 goal is to stimulate makin you high 
 and take you and i 
 to a place you cant see but i believe you can fly 
 i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin 
 im not your dad not your mom not your guardian 
 just a man whos on the mic 
 so let me entertain you 
  
  
 my lyrical content contains subject matter 
 that sucks up all these fucked up young kids 
 at an alarming rate common denominate 
 add it up and youll see just why i dominate 
 i try to stimulate but kids emulate 
 and mimic every move you make slim you great 
 but wait cant you see im only here to entertain 
 i gotta be the one to go against the grain 
 cause man i see it feel it live it but its inhumane 
 for me to see you be influenced and pretend you aint 
 but they dont understand that ive been through pain 
 if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain 
 but you cant just stand there and try to judge 
 it hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much 
 and its such a pleasure every button that i touch 
 i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but 
  
 im only entertainin you my 
 goal is to stimulate makin you high 
 and take you and i 
 to a place you cant see but i believe you can fly 
 i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin 
 im not your dad not your mom not your guardian 
 just a man whos on the mic 
 so let me entertain you 
  
 backmasked 
 im not here to save you 
 im only here for the ride 
 so let me entertain you 
 and everything will be fine	obie trice real name no gimmicks

 cause im back im on the rag and ovulating

 but it feels so empty without me 
 so come on and dip bum on your lips 
 fuck that cum on your lips and some on your tits 
 and get ready cause this shits about to get heavy 
 i just settled all my lawsuitsfuck you debbie

 little hellions kids feeling rebellious 
 embarrassed their parents still listen to elvis 
 they start feeling like prisoners helpless 
 til someone comes along on a mission and yells bitch 
 a visionary vision is scary 
 could start a revolution polluting the airwaves 
 a rebel so just let me revel and bask 
 in the fact that i got everyone kissing my ass  
 and its a disaster such a catastrophe 
 for you to see so damn much of my assyou asked for me 
 well im back nananananananananana 
 fix your bent antenna tune it in and then im gonna 
 enter in and up under your skin like a splinter 
 the center of attention back for the winter 
 im interesting the best thing since wrestling 
 infesting in your kids ears and nesting 
 testing attention please 
 feel the tension soon as someone mentions me 
 heres my ten cents my two cents is free 
 a nuisance who sent you sent for me 
  
 now this looks like a job for me

 a tiskit a taskit ill go tit for tat with 
 anybody whos talking this shit that shit 
 chris kirkpatrick you can get your ass kicked

 and moby you can get stomped by obie 
 you 36yearold baldheaded fag blow me 
 you dont know me youre too old let go 
 its over nobody listens to techno 
 now lets go just give me the signal 
 ill be there with a whole list full of new insults 
 ive been dope suspenseful with a pencil 
 ever since prince turned himself into a symbol 
 but sometimes the shit just seems 
 everybody only wants to discuss me 
 so this must mean im disgusting 
 but its just me im just obscene 
 though im not the first king of controversy 
 i am the worst thing since elvis presley 
 to do black music so selfishly 
 and use it to get myself wealthy  
 theres a concept that works 
 twenty million other white rappers emerge 
 but no matter how many fish in the sea 
 itd be so empty without me 
  
 now this looks like a job for me 
 so everybody just follow me 
 cause we need a little controversy 
 cause it feels so empty without me 
 i said this looks like a job for me

 i sit back with this pack of zigzags and this bag 
 of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be 
 the most meanest mc on this on this earth 
 and since birth ive been cursed with this curse to just curse 
 and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works 
 and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension 
 dispensing these sentences getting this stress 
 thats been eating me recently off of this chest 
 and i rest again peacefully 
 but at least have the decency in you 
 to leave me alone when you freaks see me out 
 in the streets when im eating or feeding my daughter 
 to not come and speak to me i dont know you 
 and no i dont owe you a mothafuckin thing 
 im not mr nsync im not what your friends think 
 im not mr friendly i can be a prick if you tempt me 
 my tank is on empty no patience is in me 
 and if you offend me im lifting you ten feet in the air 
 i dont care who was there and who saw me just jaw you 
 go call you a lawyer file you a lawsuit 
 ill smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe 
 im tired of all you i dont mean to be mean

 sometimes i just feel like my father 
 i hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense 
 its constant and oh its his lyrical content 
 the song guilty conscience has gotten such rotten responses 
 and all of this controversy circles me 
 and it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me 
 so i point one back at em but not the index or pinkie 
 or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up 
 when you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up 
 with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too 
 when a dudes getting bullied and shoots up his school 
 and they blame it on marilyn and the heroin 
 where were the parents at and look where its at 
 middle america now its a tragedy 
 now its so sad to see an upperclass city havin this happening 
 then attack eminem cause i rap this way 
 but im glad cause they feed me the fuel that i need 
 for the fire to burn and its burning and i have returned 
  
 and i am whatever you say i am 
 if i wasnt then why would i say i am 
 in the paper the news every day i am 
 radio wont even play my jam 
 cause i am whatever you say i am 
 if i wasnt then why would i say i am 
 in the paper the news every day i am 
 i dont know thats just the way i am 
  
  
 im so sick and tired of being admired 
 that i wish that i would just die or get fired 
 and dropped from my label lets stop with the fables 
 im not gonna be able to top on my name is 
 and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation 
 to cop me rotation at rocknroll stations 
 and i just do not got the patience 
 to deal with these cocky caucasians 
 who think im some wigger who just tries to be black 
 cause i talk with an accent and grab on my balls 
 so they always keep asking the same fucking questions 
 what school did i go to what hood i grew up in 
 the why the who what when the where and the how 
 til im grabbing my hair and im tearin it out 
 cause they driving me crazy i cant take it 
 im racin im pacin i stand and i sit 
 and im thankful for every fan that i get 
 but i cant take a shit 
 in the bathroom without someone standing by it

 in the papers the news every day i am

 im the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrollin corners 
 lookin for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters 
 im meaner in action than roscoe beatin james todd senior 
 and smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments 
 i grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth 
 with a fucked up childhood that i used as an excuse 
 and aint shit changed i kept the same mind state 
 since the third time that i failed ninth grade 
 you probably think that im a negative person 
 dont be so sure of it 
 i dont promote violence i just encourage it 
 i laugh at the sight of death 
 as i fall down a cement flight of steps 
 and land inside a bed of spider webs 
 so throw caution to the wind 
 you and a friend can jump off of a bridge 
 and if you live do it again 
 shit why not blow your brain out im blowin mine out

 and pigeonholed into some poppy sensation 
 to cop me rotation at rock n roll stations 
 and i just do not got the patience  
 to deal with these cocky caucasians 
 who think im some wigger who just tries to be black cause i talk 
 with an accent and grab on my balls so they always 
 keep askin the same fuckin questions

 the why the who what when the where and the how 
 til im grabbin my hair and im tearin it out 
 cause they drivin me crazy  i cant take it

 hi there little boys and girls  
 today were gonna learn how to poison squirrels 
 but first id like you to meet my friend bob  
 say hi bob  
 bobs 30 and still lives with his mom 
 and he dont got a job cause bob sits at home and smokes pot 
 but his twelveyearold brother looks up to him an awful lot 
 and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot 
 and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock 
 when its late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog 
 drag em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks  
 and even if they escaped and they got the cops 
 the ladies would all be so afraid they would drop the charge 
 til one night mrs stacey went off the job 
 when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk 
 but stacey knew it was bob and said knock it off 
 but bob wouldnt knock it off cause hes crazy and off his rocker 
 crazier than slim shady is off the vodka 
 you couldnt even take him to dres to get bob a doctor 
 he grabbed stace by the legs as he chopped it off her 
 and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her 
 but ever since the day stacey went off to wander 
 they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner 
 and thats the story of bob and his marijuana 
 and what it might do to you 
 so see if the squirrels want itits bad for you 
  
 see children drugs are bad  
 and if you dont believe me ask your dad  
 and if you dont believe him ask your mom  
 shell tell you how she does em all the time  
 so kids say no to drugs  
 so you dont act like everyone else does  
 and theres really nothin else to say  
 drugs are just bad mmkay 
  
  
 my penis is the size of a peanut have you seen it 
 fuck no you aint seen it its the size of a peanut  
 speakin of peanuts you know what else is bad for squirrels 
 ecstasyits the worst drug in the world 
 if someone ever offers it to you dont do it 
 kids two hitsll probably drain all your spinal fluid 
 and spinal fluid is final you wont get it back 
 so dont get attached or itll attack every bone in your back 
 meet zach twentyone years old 
 after hangin out with some friends at a frat party he gets bold 
 and decides to try five when hes bribed by five guys 
 and the peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it 
 suddenly he starts to convulse 
 and his pulse goes into hyperdrive 
 and his eyes roll back in his skull  
 his back starts to look like the mcdonalds arches 
 hes on donalds carpet layin horizontal barfin  
 and everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him 
 hey adam zach is a jackass look at him 
 cause they took it too so they think its funny 
 so theyre laughing at basically nothing 
 except maybe wasting their money 
 meanwhile zachs in a coma the action is over 
 and his back and his shoulders hunched up like hes practicin yoga 
 and thats the story of zach the ecstasy maniac 
 so dont even feed that to squirrels class cause its bad for you 
  
 see children drugs are bad  
 and if you dont believe me ask your dad  
 and if you dont believe him ask your mom  
 shell tell you how she does em all the time  
 so kids say no to drugs  
 so you dont act like everyone else does  
 and theres really nothin else to say  
 drugs are just bad mmkay 
  
  
 and last but not least one of the most humongous 
 problems among young people today is fungus 
 it grows from cow manure they pick it out wipe it off bag it up 
 and you put it right in your mouth and chew it 
 yumyum then you start to see some dumb stuff 
 and everything slows down when you eat some of em 
 and sometimes you see things that arent there  
 like fat women in gstrings with orange hair 
  its yarn claire 
 women stick em up their behinds go out and wear em  
 and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms 
 whoops did i say magic mushrooms i meant fungus 
 your tongue gets all swoll up like a cows tongue 
  cause it comes from a cows dung  
 see drugs are bad its a common fact 
 but your mom and dad know thats all that im good at  
 but dont be me cause if you grow up and you go and od 
 theyre gonna come for me and ima have to grow a goatee 
 and get a disguise and hide cause itll be my fault 
 so dont do drugs and do exactly as i dont cause im bad for you 
  
 see children drugs are bad  
 and if you dont believe me ask your dad  
 and if you dont believe him ask your mom  
 shell tell you how she does em all the time  
 so kids say no to drugs  
 so you dont act like everyone else does  
 and theres really nothin else to say  
 drugs are just bad mmkay 
  
  
 come on children clap along

 drugs are just bad drugs are just bad  
 so dont do drugs  
 so therell be more for me

 my bum is on your lips my bum is on your lips 
 and if im lucky you might just give it a little kiss 
 and thats the message that we deliver to little kids 
 and expect them not to know what a womans clitoris is 
 of course theyre gonna know what intercourse is 
 by the time they hit fourth grade 
 theyve got the discovery channel dont they 
 we aint nothin but mammalswell some of us cannibals 
 who cut other people open like cantaloupes 
 but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes 
 then theres no reason that a man and another man cant elope 
 but if you feel like i feel i got the antidote 
 women wave your pantyhose sing the chorus and it goes

 and im jerking but this whole bag of viagra isnt working 
 and every single person is a slim shady lurking

 or in the parking lot circling screaming i dont give a fuck 
 with his windows down and his system up

 im the illest rapper to hold the cordless patrollin corners 
 lookin for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters 
 im meaner in action than roscoe beatin james todd senior 
 across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments 
 i grew up in a wild hood as a hazardous youth 
 with a fucked up childhood that i used as an excuse 
 and aint shit changed i kept the same mindstate 
 since the third time that i failed ninth grade 
 you probably think that im a negative person dont be so sure of it 
 i dont promote violence i just encourage it 
 i laugh at the sight of death as i fall down a cement flight of steps 
 and land inside a bed of spider webs 
 so throw caution to the wind you and a friend 
 can jump off of a bridge and if you live do it again 
 shit why not blow your brain out im blowin mine out

 i knew that just the two of us would make you hate me this much 
 and just the two of us that aint got shit to do with us

 you ready one two three 
  
  
 the more you put me through 
 the more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 you say you hate me i just love you more 
 you dont want me i just want you more 
 i buy you flowers you throw em at me 
 i know its sad but its makin me happy 
 the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 
 cause you love me and i love you more 
  
  
 its sick but who could ever predict wed be doin the same shit 
 we say we do it for our baby but we dont 
 we do it for us its lust cause neither one 
 of us trust each other so we fuck til we bust 
 and we cuss each other out we know what its about shout 
 til i throw you out the house you throw me out the house 
 i throw you on the couch punch you in the mouth 
 fist fight til we turn this mother out 
 then apologize after laughter pain 
 its insane were back in the same chapter again 
 and its sad but its true when im layin here with you 
 there aint nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cause 
  
 the more you put me through 
 the more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 you say you hate me i just love you more 
 you dont want me i just want you more 
 i buy you flowers you throw em at me 
 i know its sad but its makin me happy 
 the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 
 cause you love me and i love you more 
  
  
 cause i hate you do you hate me 
 good cause youre so fuckin beautiful when youre angry 
 it makes me wanna just take you and just throw you 
 on the bed and fuck you like i dont even know you 
 you fuck other people and i fuck other people 
 youre a slut but im equal im a mutt were both evil 
 in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it 
 cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it 
 we can make accusations people spread rumors 
 but they aint got proof til they do its just the two of us 
 its you and me cause any chick can say that she screwin me 
 but you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed 
 if you didnt i wouldnt be hittin  yeah i would 
 cause the sex is too damn good if i ran who would i run to 
 that would be this soft and warm 
 so its off and on usually more off than on 
 but at least we know that we share this common bond 
 youre the only one i can fuck without a condom on 
 i hope the only reason that i cope is cause of that fact 
 and plus i can bust in that and thats why 
  
 the more you put me through 
 the more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 you say you hate me i just love you more 
 you dont want me i just want you more 
 i buy you flowers you throw em at me 
 i know its sad but its makin me happy 
 the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 
 cause you love me and i love you more 
  
  
 i can never understand it thats why i dont try 
 from junior high until we both die its silly 
 oh why must we try is it really so rough 
 that we must always call each others billy goats gruff 
 try to pull each others legs until the other begs 
 were lyin to ourselves thats the beauty of it yeah 
 cause we truly love each other thats why we always fightin 
 all we do is shove each other every other fuckin night 
 and its clear it aint gonna change its pentup rage 
 we both had we both feel like weve been upstaged 
 by someone else weve both been someone elses 
 someone else problem is neither one wants help 
 its an addiction and it cant be fixed 
 our familys mixed up theres a baby sister in the mix 
 and it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle dont fit 
 and anybody who thinks they know us doesnt know shit 
 and theyre probably just tired of hearin it all the time 
 on every song every lyric and every rhyme 
 all the hoopla all of the whooptywoo 
 what you put me through fuckin whooptydo 
 but i wont be made a fool of if this is true love 
 you wouldnt do what you did last time you wouldnt screw up 
 this time cause this time girl im tellin you what 
 you do it again im fuckin you up 
  
 no matter what you say or what you do 
 ima hunt you down til i find you 
 no matter where you run ill be right there 
 right behind you in your nightmares 
 so i brought you the flowers and the candy 
 all the times that you threw it back at me 
 told me you hate me you gon hate me more 
 when you find out you cant escape me whore 
  
  
 the more you put me through 
 the more it makes me wanna come back to you 
 you say you hate me i just love you more 
 you dont want me i just want you more 
 i buy you flowers you throw em at me 
 i know its sad but its makin me happy 
 the more that you slap me the more that it turns me on 
 cause you love me and i love you more	uncle marshall will you tell us a bedtime story

 do you believe it can you receive it 
 god is a girl whatever you say 
 do you believe it can you receive it 
 god is a girl however you live 
 do you believe it can you receive it 
 god is a girl shes only a girl 
 do you believe it can you receive it 
  
  
 his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy 
 theres vomit on his sweater already moms spaghetti 
 hes nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
 to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting 
 what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud 
 he opens his mouth but the words wont come out 
 hes choking how everybodys joking now 
 the clocks run out times up overblaow 
 snap back to reality there goes gravity 
 there goes rabbit he choked hes so mad but he wont 
 give up that easy no he wont have it he knows 
 his whole backs to these ropes it dont matter hes dope 
 he knows that but hes broke hes so stagnant he knows 
 when he goes back to this mobile home thats when its 
 back to the lab again yo 
  
 one shot or one opportunity 
 to seize everything you ever wanted in one moment 
  
  
 i got some skeletons in my closet 
 and i dont know if no one knows it 
 so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it 
 ima expose it ill take you back to 73 
 before i ever had a multiplatinumselling cd 
 i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months 
 my  father must have had his panties up in a bunch 
 cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye 
 no i dont on second thought i just  wished he would die 
 i look at hailie and i couldnt picture leavin her side 
 even if i hated kim id grit my teeth and id try 
 to make it work with her at least for hailies sake 
 i maybe made some mistakes 
 but im only human but im man enough to face em today 
 what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb 
 but the smartest  i did was take the bullets out of that gun 
 cause ida  i woulda shot kim and him both 
 its my life id like to welcome yall to the eminem show 
  
  
 god is a girl wherever you are 
 do you believe it can you receive it 
 god is a girl whatever you say 
 do you believe it can you receive it 
 god is a girl however you live 
 do you believe it can you receive it 
 god is a girl shes only a girl 
 do you believe it can you receive it 
  
 no more games ima change what you call rage 
 tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged 
 i was playin in the beginning the mood all changed 
 ive been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
 but i kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher 
 best believe somebodys payin the pied piper 
 all the pain inside amplified by the 
 fact that i cant get by with my nineto 
 five and i cant provide the right type of life for my family 
 cause man these goddamn food stamps dont buy diapers 
 and theres no movie theres no mekhi phifer this is my life 
 and these times are so hard and its gettin even harder 
 tryna feed and water my seed plus teetertotter 
 caught up between bein a father and a prima donna 
 baby mama drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna 
 stay in one spot another day of monotonys 
 gotten me to the point im like a snail ive got 
 to formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot 
 success is my only motherfuckin optionfailures not 
 mom i love you but this trailers got 
 to go i cannot grow old in salems lot 
 so here i go its my shot feet fail me not 
 this may be the only opportunity that i got 
  
  
 god is a girl	yo check it out 
 its fucked up 
 cause i dont see either one of us budging 
  
  
 im withholdin my anger though id like to be the strangler 
 of this punk ass little pussys puny neck 
 its my right to insist that he acknowledge my existence 
 but he just displays complete lack of respect 
 thats what he says to himself as he uses his magazines to trash me 
 as he sits with both his feet up at his desk 
 smokes a bag of his weed and starts imaginin things 
 and he just cant see that hes manically depressed 
 and in his jealousy and envy it just whirls him in a frenzy 
 as he turns on mtv and sees my face 
 he dont exist in this world so he just twists and he twirls 
 spirals and spins til he hurls himself into a rage 
 and its destroyin him slowly cause he does not even know me 
 even though he sees me everywhere he goes 
 so he just tortures himself he has no fortune and wealth 
 so he extorts someone else to get his dough 
 and now hes actin like a bully so he tries to push and pull me 
 but he knows that he cant fool me so hes mad 
 and he has no choice but to scream and raise his voice up at me 
 cause it annoys him to see that i aint scared 
  
 you aint no motherfuckin bully 
 and i aint bowin to no motherfuckin bully 
 i wont allow it aint gon cower to no bully 
 ill be damned if i dont stand up to a bully 
 fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully 
 and i know it must be fuckin wit you emotionally 
  
  
 now im not tryin to make no more enemies no more unfortunately 
 theres so many other motherfuckers there just are 
 they just keep houndin at me now that im down with 50 
 suddenly now i got beef with this faggot ja  
 but his ass is such a puppet irv could shove his whole hand up it 
 and just make him say what he wants him to say 
 but suge has irv on a string and irvs so nervous that he 
 says anything to this man to keep him at bay 
 so now ja thinks that hes so tough and murder incs the big bad wolf 
 and they go huff and puff and blow our label down 
 but our buildings made out of bricks so you aint takin out shit 
 and dawg you just did a song with bobby brown 
 so now you try to pull the race card and it backfires in your face hard 
 cause you know we dont play that black and white shit 
 plus this stylist you fucked when you was ecstasied up 
 was just a man whos dressed up as a white bitch 
  
 you aint no motherfuckin bully 
 and i aint bowin to no motherfuckin bully 
 i wont allow it aint gon cower to no bully 
 ill be damned if i dont stand up to a bully 
 fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully 
 you must be takin too much e 
  
  
 now what bothers me the most about hiphop is were so close 
 to pickin up where we left off with big and pac 
 we just lost jam master j big l got blasted away 
 plus we lost bugz slang ton and freaky tah 
 its like a neverending cycle that just seems to come full circle 
 everybodys gotta be so fuckin hard 
 and im not excludin myself cause i been stupid as well 
 i been known to lose it when someone says something smart 
 but as we grow as men we learn to let shit go but then again 
 theres only so much bullshit we can really stand 
 we all got reps to uphold when someone steps on our toes 
 its no exception it goes for every man 
 but if irv really gave a fuck about ja like he claims he does 
 hed wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs 
 but he just keeps feedin him pills so if that e doesnt kill him 
 someone from gunit will and i aint buzzed 
 dawg im talkin to you straight if the situation escalates 
 any worse were gonna lose another soldier to this game 
 and if i get killed for this rap i got a million in cash 
 that says i will get you back in hailies name 
  
 you aint no motherfuckin bully 
 and i aint bowin to no motherfuckin bully 
 i wont allow it aint gon cower to no bully 
 ill be damned if i dont stand up to a bully 
 fight like a man and throw my hands up to a bully 
 irvine get your boy off of that e

 im only entertainin you my 
 goal is to stimulate makin you high 
 and take you and i 
 to a place you cant see but i believe you can fly 
 i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin 
 im not your dad not your mom not your guardian 
 just a man whos on the mic 
 so let me entertain you 
  
  
 my lyrical content is constantly under fire 
 no wonder why i constantly bomb back 
 to combat attacks with constant concepts 
 when lyrics are constantly took outta context 
 failure to communicate with congress has 
 been a problem for the longest i guess 
 but maybe one day we can make some progress 
 food for thought see how long it takes to digest 
 feelin good when i should be ashamed 
 shit i really shoulda fell but i stood see i came 
 like a flame in the night 
 like a ghost in the dark 
 theres a ray theres a light 
 theres a hope theres a spark 
 but when planets collide theyll never see eye to eye 
 until they decide to set the differences aside 
 and this is why only one of us will survive 
 so children follow my lead and feel the vibe because 
  
 im only entertainin you my 
 goal is to stimulate makin you high 
 and take you and i 
 to a place you cant see but i believe you can fly 
 i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin 
 im not your dad not your mom not your guardian 
 just a man whos on the mic 
 so let me entertain you 
  
  
 my music can be slightly amusin 
 you shouldnt take lyrics so serious it might be confusin 
 just tryin to separate the truth from entertainment 
 its stupid aint it i get sick of tryin to explain it 
 see i could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond 
 just being a snot pointynosed bleachblond 
 cause i came here to uplift let your woes be gone 
 tell em to get fucked and just mosey on 
 constantly movin constantly usin 
 the constitution as a form of restitution 
 bless the children nothin less than brilliant 
 let me entertain you like robbie williams 
 ill be here when yall are gone rebuildin 
 world revolvin still evolvin still slim 
 how many kids will copy probly millions 
 but ima do this as a fuckin hobby till then cause 
  
 im only entertainin you my 
 goal is to stimulate makin you high 
 and take you and i 
 to a place you cant see but i believe you can fly 
 i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin 
 im not your dad not your mom not your guardian 
 just a man whos on the mic 
 so let me entertain you 
  
  
 my lyrical content contains subject matter 
 that sucks up all these fucked up young kids 
 at an alarming rate common denominate 
 add it up and youll see just why i dominate 
 i try to stimulate but kids emulate 
 and mimic every move you make slim you great 
 but wait cant you see im only here to entertain 
 i gotta be the one to go against the grain 
 cause man i see it feel it live it but its inhumane 
 for me to see you be influenced and pretend you aint 
 but they dont understand that ive been through pain 
 if you get to know me i could be a friend you gain 
 but you cant just stand there and try to judge 
 it hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much 
 and its such a pleasure every button that i touch 
 i treasure every glutton that i punish in my lust but 
  
 im only entertainin you my 
 goal is to stimulate makin you high 
 and take you and i 
 to a place you cant see but i believe you can fly 
 i dont mean nobody harm im just partyin 
 im not your dad not your mom not your guardian 
 just a man whos on the mic 
 so let me entertain you 
  
 backmasked 
 im not here to save you 
 im only here for the ride 
 so let me entertain you 
 and everything will be fine	some days i just wanna up and call it quits 
 i feel like im surrounded by a wall of bricks 
 every time i go to get up i just fall in pits 
 my lifes like one great big ball of shit 
 if i could just put it all into all i spit 
 stead of always tryna swallow it 
 instead of starin at this wall and shit 
 while i sit writers block sick of all this shit 
 cant call it shit all i know is im about to hit the wall 
 if i have to see another one of moms alcoholic fits 
 this is it last straw thats all thats it 
 i aint dealin with another fuckin politic 
 im like a skillet bubblin until it filters up 
 im about to kill it i can feel it buildin up 
 blow this building up ive concealed enough 
 my cup runneth over i done filled it up 
 the pen explodes and busts ink spills my guts 
 you think all i do is stand here and feel my nuts 
 well ima show you what you gon feel my rush

 peel the dutch im about to tear shit up 
 goosebumps yeah ima make your hair sit up 
 yeah sit up ima tell you who i be

 you wait it aint too late to finally see 
 what you closedminded fucks were too blind to see 
 whoever finds me is gonna get a finders fee 
 out this world aint no one out their mind as me 
 you need peace of mind heres a piece of mine 
 all i needs a line 
 but sometimes i dont always find the words to rhyme 
 to express how im really feelin at that time 
 yeah sometimes sometimes sometimes 
 its just sometimes its always me 
 how dark can these hallways be 
 the clock strikes midnight one two then halfpast three 
 this halfassed rhyme with this halfassed piece 
 of paper  im desperate at my desk 
 if i can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again 
 stuck in a slump cant think of nothin 
 fuck im stumped up oh wait here comes somethin 
  nope its not good enough scribble it out

 fuckin boiling point put some oil in your joints

 to leave d12 in this but we cant selfdestruct 
 ive never felt it this much cmon fellas get up

 i walk with a limp pistol hanging off of the hip 
 im awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth 
 your carcass is split even if beef is partially thick 
 we cant take you seriously you a comedy skit 
 you probably wish that you could be out shooting at gs 
 but the only thing you shoot is the breeze i cant believe 
 you speaking on moving keys but every time we hear you kick it 
 the only thing that you selling is woof tickets

 so when they bust you better bust back or get your guts clapped outta your stomach 
 and when they want it ill bring a hundred niggas from runyon so get to gunnin if you coming

 how many people are proud to be citizens 
 of this beautiful country of ours the stripes and the stars 
 for the rights that men have died for to protect 
 the women and men who have broke their necks 
 for the freedom of speech the united states government has sworn to uphold or so were told 
  
  
  
 i never wouldve dreamed in a million years id see 
 so many motherfuckin people who feel like me 
 who share the same views and the same exact beliefs 
 its like a fuckin army marchin in back of me 
 so many lives i touched so much anger aimed 
 in no particular direction just sprays and sprays 
 and straight through your radio waves it plays and plays 
 til it stays stuck in your head for days and days 
 who wouldve thought standin in this mirror bleachin my hair 
 with some peroxide reachin for a tshirt to wear 
 that i would catapult to the forefront of rap like this 
 how could i predict my words would have an impact like this 
 i mustve struck a chord with somebody up in the office 
 cause congress keep tellin me i aint causin nothin but problems 
 and now theyre sayin im in trouble with the government 
 im lovin it i shoveled shit all my life and now im dumpin it on 
  
 white america i could be one of your kids 
 white america little eric looks just like this

 i aint have to graduate from lincoln high school to know that 
 but i could rap so fuck school im too cool to go back 
 give me the mic show me where the fuckin studios at 
 when i was underground no one gave a fuck i was white 
 no labels wanted to sign me almost gave up i was like 
 fuck it until i met dre the only one to look past 
 gave me a chance and i lit a fire up under his ass 
 helped him get back to the top every fan black that i got 
 was probly his in exchange for every white fan that hes got 
 like damn we just swapped sittin back lookin at shit wow

 white america i could be one of your kids 
 white america little eric looks just like this

 i go to trl look how many hugs i get 
  
  
 see the problem is i speak to suburban kids 
 who otherwise wouldve never knew these words exist 
 whose moms probly wouldve never gave two squirts of piss 
 til i created so much motherfuckin turbulence 
 straight out the tube right into your livin rooms i came 
 and kids flipped when they knew i was produced by dre 
 thats all it took and they were instantly hooked right in 
 and they connected with me too because i looked like them 
 thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope 
 searchin with a fine tooth comb its like this rope 
 waitin to choke tightenin around my throat 
 watchin me while i write this like i dont like this note 
 all i hear is lyrics lyrics constant controversy 
 sponsors workin round the clock to try to stop my concerts early 
 surely hiphop was never a problem in harlem only in boston 
 after it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom 
 so now im catchin the flak from these activists when they raggin 
 actin like im the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot shit 
 just look at me like im your closest pal 
 the poster child the motherfuckin spokesman now for 
  
 white america i could be one of your kids 
 white america little eric looks just like this 
 white america erica loves my shit 
 i go to trl look how many hugs i get  
 white america i could be one of your kids 
 white america little eric looks just like this 
 white america erica loves my shit 
 i go to trl look how many hugs i get 
  
  
 so to the parents of america i am the derringer 
 aimed at little erica to attack her character 
 the ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns 
 sent to lead the march right up to the steps of congress 
 and piss on the lawns of the white house 
 to burn the galf and replace it with a parental advisory sticker 
 to spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy 
 fuck you ms cheney fuck you tipper gore 
 fuck you with the freest of speech this divided states of embarrassment will allow me to have fuck you 
 ha ha ha im just playin america 
 you know i love you	wheres my snare 
 i have no snare in my headphones 
 there you go yeah yo yo 
  
  
 have you ever been hated or discriminated against 
 i have ive been protested and demonstrated against 
 picket signs for my wicked rhymes look at the times 
 sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid thats behind 
 all this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin 
 tempers flarin from parents just blow em off and keep goin 
 not takin nothin from no one give em hell long as im breathin 
 keep kickin ass in the morning and takin names in the evenin 
 leave em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth 
 see they can trigger me but theyll never figure me out 
 look at me now i bet youre probly sick of me now 
 aint you mama ima make you look so ridiculous now 
  
  
 im sorry mama 
 i never meant to hurt you 
 i never meant to make you cry 
 but tonight im cleanin out my closet  
 i said im sorry mama 
 i never meant to hurt you 
 i never meant to make you cry 
 but tonight im cleanin out my closet  
  
 i got some skeletons in my closet 
 and i dont know if no one knows it 
 so before they throw me inside my coffin and close it 
 ima expose it ill take you back to 73 
 before i ever had a multiplatinumselling cd 
 i was a baby maybe i was just a couple of months 
 my faggot father mustve had his panties up in a bunch 
 cause he split i wonder if he even kissed me goodbye 
 no i dont on second thought i just fuckin wished he would die 
 i look at hailie and i couldnt picture leavin her side 
 even if i hated kim id grit my teeth and id try 
 to make it work with her at least for hailies sake 
 i maybe made some mistakes 
 but im only human but im man enough to face em today 
 what i did was stupid no doubt it was dumb 
 but the smartest shit i did was take the bullets out of that gun 
 cause ida killed em shit i woulda shot kim and him both 
 its my life id like to welcome yall to the eminem show 
  
  
 im sorry mama 
 i never meant to hurt you 
 i never meant to make you cry 
 but tonight im cleanin out my closet  
 i said im sorry mama 
 i never meant to hurt you 
 i never meant to make you cry 
 but tonight im cleanin out my closet  
  
 now i would never diss my own mama just to get recognition 
 take a second to listen fore you think this record is dissin 
 but put yourself in my position just try to envision 
 witnessin your mama poppin prescription pills in the kitchen 
 bitchin that someones always goin through her purse and shits missin 
 goin through public housing systems 
 victim of mnchausens syndrome 
 my whole life i was made to believe i was sick when i wasnt 
 til i grew up now i blew up 
 it makes you sick to your stomach doesnt it 
 wasnt it the reason you made that cd for me ma 
 so you could try to justify the way you treated me ma 
 but guess what youre gettin older now 
 and its cold when youre lonely 
 and nathans growin up so quick 
 hes gonna know that youre phony 
 and hailies gettin so big now you should see her shes beautiful 
 but youll never see her she wont even be at your funeral  
 see what hurts me the most is you wont admit you was wrong 
 bitch do your song keep tellin yourself that you was a mom 
 but how dare you try to take what you didnt help me to get 
 you selfish bitch i hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit 
 remember when ronnie died and you said you wished it was me 
 well guess what i am dead dead to you as can be 
  
 im sorry mama 
 i never meant to hurt you 
 i never meant to make you cry 
 but tonight im cleanin out my closet  
 i said im sorry mama 
 i never meant to hurt you 
 i never meant to make you cry 
 but tonight im cleanin out my closet	people it feels so good to be back

 and got the rep of a villain for weapon concealin 
 took the image of a thug kept shit appealin 
 willin to stick out my neck for respect 
 if it meant life or death never live to regret what i said 
 when youre me people just wanna see if its true 
 if its youwhat you say in your raps what you do 
 so they feel its part of your obligation to fulfill 
 when they see you on the streets face to face are you for real 
 in confrontation aint no conversation if you feel 
 youre in violation any hesitationll get you killed 
 if you feel it kill it if you conceal it reveal it 
 being reasonablell leave you full of bullets pull it

 an excellent method to get rid of the next bully 
 its actually better cause instead of you murderin 
 you can hurt em and come back again and kick dirt at em 
 its like pourin salt in the wounds assault and get sued 
 you can smell the lawsuits soon as i waltz in the room 
 everybody halts and stops calls the cops

 runnin and duckin out the hot rocks parking lot

 and lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me 
 and put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity im a

 i thought i had it all figured out i did 
 i thought i was tough enough to stick it out with kim 
 but i wasnt tough enough to juggle two things at once 
 i found myself layin on my knees in cuffs 
 which shouldve been a reason enough for me to get my stuff 
 and just leave how come i couldnt see this shit myself 
 its just me nobody couldnt see the shit i felt 
 knowin damn well she wasnt gonna be there when i fell 
 to catch me the minute shit was heated she just bailed 
 im standin here swingin on like thirty people by myself 
 i couldnt even see the millimeter when it fell 
 turned around saw gary stashin the heater in his belt 
 saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground 
 i just sold two million records i dont need to go to jail 
 im not about to lose my freedom over no female 
 i need to slow down try to get my feet on solid ground 
 so for now

 yo i cant sing but 
 i feel like singing 
 i wanna fuckin sing 
 cause im happy 
 yeah im happy 
 i got my baby back 
 yo check it out 
  
  
 some days i sit starin out the window 
 watchin this world pass me by 
 sometimes i think theres nothin to live for 
 i almost break down and cry 
 sometimes i think im crazy im crazy oh so crazy 
 why am i here am i just wastin my time 
 but then i see my baby suddenly im not crazy 
 it all makes sense when i look into her eyes oh no 
  
  
 cause sometimes  it feels like  the worlds on my shoulders 
 everyones leanin on me 
 cause sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over 
 but then she comes back to me 
  
 my baby girl keeps gettin older 
 i watch her grow up with pride 
 people make jokes cause they dont understand me 
 they just dont see my real side 
 i act like shit dont faze me inside it drives me crazy 
 my insecurities could eat me alive 
 but then i see my baby suddenly im not crazy 
 it all makes sense when i look into her eyes oh no 
  
  
 cause sometimes it feels like the worlds on my shoulders 
 everyones leanin on me 
 cause sometimes it feels like the worlds almost over 
 but then she comes back to me 
  
  
 man if i could sing id keep singin this song to my daughter 
 if i could hit the notes id blow somethin as long as my father 
 to show her how i feel about her how proud i am that i got her 
 god im a daddy im so glad that her mom didnt reh tnaw 
 now you probably get this picture from my public persona 
 that im a pistolpackin drug addict who bags on his momma 
 but i wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest 
 cause theres a lot of shit i keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul 
 and just know that i grow colder the older i grow 
 this boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold 
 and this load is like the weight of the world and i think my neck is breakin 
 should i just give up or try to live up to these expectations 
 now look i love my daughter more than life in itself 
 but i got a wife thats determined to make my life livin hell 
 but i handle it well given the circumstances im dealt 
 so many chances man its too bad coulda had someone else 
 but the years that ive wasted is nothin to the tears that ive tasted 
 so heres what im facin three felonies six years of probation 
 ive went to jail for this woman ive been to bat for this woman 
 ive taken bats to peoples backs bent over backwards for this woman 
 man i shoulda seen it comin whatd i stick my penis up in 
 wouldnt have ripped the prenup up if ida seen what she was fuckin 
 but fuck it its over theres no more reason to cry no more 
 i got my baby maybe the only lady that i adore 
 hailie so sayonara try tomorrow nice to know ya 
 our babys traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner 
 and suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted 
 its like the greatest gift you can get the weight has been lifted and 
  
 now it dont feel like the worlds on my shoulders 
 everyones leanin on me 
 cause my baby knows that her daddys a soldier 
 nothin can take her from me 
  
  
 wooo told you i cant sing 
 oh welli tried 
 hailie member when i said 
 if you ever need anything daddy would be right there 
 guess whatdaddys here 
 and i aint goin nowhere baby 
 i love you	this motherfucker man 
  
  
  
 its ridiculous i cant believe itoh hold on a minute em 
 what up 
 have a seat dre ill call you back 
  
 what now 
 i dont even know where to start 
 okay 
 i got the album from upstairs 
 and 
 and this is by far the most 
  
 incredible thing ive ever heard	heh so im out the game huh  
 yo dre we ridin 
 whatever  
 well im wit ya homie 
 okay lets handle the small shit 
  
  
 i was born to brew up storms stir up shit 
 kick up dust cuss til i slur up spit 
 grew up too quick went through too much knew too much shit 
 corrupt and ima pour it on like syrup bitch 
 thick and rich sick and twisted mr buttersworth 
 dre told me to milk this shit for what its worth 
 til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth 
 and if i fumble a verse keep goin 
 first take i make mistakes just keep it 
 no punches pull no punches thats weak shit 
 fake shit if i ever take shit ill eat shit 
 wasnt for him wouldnt be shit 
 creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane 
 been here longer than anyone in the game 
 and i aint got to lie about my age  but what about jermaine 
 fuck jermaine he dont belong speakin mine 
 or timbalands name and dont think i dont read 
 your little interviews and see what youre sayin 
 and im a giant and i aint gotta move til im provoked 
 when i see you ima step on you and not even know it 
 you midget minime with a bunch of little miniyous 
 runnin around your backyard swimming pools 
 over 80 million records sold 
 and i aint have to do it with 10 or 11yearolds 
  
 cause what you say is what you say say what you say 
 how you say it whenever you sayin it just remember 
 how you said it when you was sprayin it so who you playin with 
 huh  
 cause what you say is what you say say what you say 
 how you say it whenever you sayin it just remember 
 how you said it when you was sprayin it so who you playin with 
 huh  
  
  
 second verse it gets worse it gets no better than this 
 amateurs drink veteran piss 
 from a dixie cup if you ever mix me up 
 or confuse me with a canibus or dre with a dupri 
 well rub it in every club youre in well have you blackballed 
 and make sure you never rap afuckingain 
 dre aint havin it long as im here to play devils advocate 
 if there was some magic shit i could wave 
 over the industry that could save it when im gone 
 and buried to make sure the tradition carries on i would 
 if i could only use this power for good i wouldnt not even if i could 
 from the hood and im a hornet 
 and ima only sting when im cornered 
 and ima only sucker punch and swing without warning 
 and swing to knock somebodys fuckin head off 
 cause i know if they get up i wont get a chance to let off 
 another punch im punk rock no ones punk 
 dont give a fuck whitepac so much spunk 
 when i was little i knew i would blow up and sell a mil 
 or grow up to be attila go nuts and be a killer 
 and im something of a phenom one puff of the chron 
 im unstoppable im alive and 
 on top again theres no obstacle that i cant conquer 
 so come along with us  
  
 cause what you say is what you say say what you say 
 how you say it whenever you sayin it just remember 
 how you said it when you was sprayin it so who you playin with 
 huh  
 cause what you say is what you say say what you say 
 how you say it whenever you sayin it just remember 
 how you said it when you was sprayin it so who you playin with 
 huh  
  
  
 now anybody who knows dre knows im about 
 fast cars and aliz partyin all day 
 but i handled my business cause its work before play 
 dont look for trouble but ill serve you gourmet 
 however you want it you can have it your way 
 you fuck my night up ima fuck up your day 
 bullet with your name sendin it your way 
 that goes for anyone who walks through that doorway 
 cause this is my space you invade it 
 live to regret it and youll die tryna violate it 
 fuck around get annihilated eyes dilated 
 huh like my old lady 
 cause what you say is what you say sometimes what you mean 
 is two different things depending on your mood if it swings 
 think too many things little hit of dres weed 
 i can do anything catch a contact 
 and im gone and im back i speed write 
 and my loose leafs my launchpad  and i can pull any string 
 dont have to prove anything catch a contract 
 on your head you headed west talk shit about dre 
 you better get a vest and invest in something to protect 
 your head and neck  and its back and forth 
 all day like red and meth i joke when i say im the best 
 in the booth but a lot of truth is said in jest 
 and if i ever do live to be a legend 
 ima die a sudden death five mics in the source 
 aint holdin my fuckin breath but ill suffocate for the respect 
 fore i breathe to collect a fuckin check 
  
 cause what you say is what you say say what you say 
 how you say it whenever you sayin it just remember 
 how you said it when you was sprayin it so who you playin with 
 huh  
 cause what you say is what you say say what you say 
 how you say it whenever you sayin it just remember 
 how you said it when you was sprayin it so who you playin with 
 huh  
  
  
 watch your fuckin mouth 
 yo this timbaland tell him i said suck my dick	cause sometimes you just feel tired feel weak 
  
 and when you feel weak  
 you feel like you wanna just give up  
 but you gotta search within you  
 try to find that inner strength  
 and just pull that shit out of you  
 and get that motivation to not give up  
 and not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall 
  
 flat on your face and collapse 
  
  
 til i collapse im spillin these raps long as you feel em 
 til the day that i drop youll never say that im not killin em 
 cause when i am not then ima stop pennin em 
 and i am not hiphop and im just not eminem 
 subliminal thoughts when ima stop sendin em 
 women are caught in webs spin em and hock venom 
 adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop 
 amoxicillins just not real enough 
 the criminal copkillin hiphop villain 
 a minimal swap to cop millions of pac listeners 
 youre comin with me feel it or not 
 youre gonna fear it like i showed you the spirit of god lives in us 
 you hear it a lot lyrics to shock 
 is it a miracle or am i just product of pop fizzin up 
 fo shizzle my wizzle this is the plot listen up 
 you bizzles forgot slizzle does not give a fuck 
  
 til the roof comes off til the lights go out 
 til my legs give out cant shut my mouth 
 til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps 
 ima rip this shit til my bones collapse 
  til the roof comes off til the lights go out 
  til my legs give out cant shut my mouth 
  til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps 
  ima rip this shit til my bones collapse 
  
  
 music is like magic theres a certain feelin you get 
 when you real and you spit and people are feelin your shit 
 this is your moment and every single minute you spend 
 tryna hold on to it cause you may never get it again 
 so while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can 
 and when your run is over just admit when its at its end 
 cause im at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in 
 i got a list heres the order of my list that its in 
 it goes reggie jayz 2pac and biggie 
 andr from outkast jada kurupt nas and then me 
 but in this industry im the cause of a lot of envy 
 so when im not put on this list the shit does not offend me 
 thats why you see me walk around like nothings botherin me 
 even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me 
 you hate it but you know respect you got to give me 
 the presss wet dream like bobby and whitney  nate hit me 
  
 til the roof comes off til the lights go out 
 til my legs give out cant shut my mouth 
 til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps 
 ima rip this shit til my bones collapse 
  til the roof comes off til the lights go out 
  til my legs give out cant shut my mouth 
  til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps 
  ima rip this shit til my bones collapse 
  
  
 soon as a verse starts i eat at an mcs heart 
 what is he thinking how not to go against me smart 
 and its absurd how people hang on every word 
 ill probly never get the props i feel i ever deserve 
 but ill never be served my spot is forever reserved 
 if i ever leave earth that would be the death of me first 
 cause in my heart of hearts i know nothin could ever be worse 
 thats why im clever when i put together every verse 
 my thoughts are sporadic i act like im an addict 
 i rap like im addicted to smack like im kim mathers 
 but i dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles 
 the fact is i would rather sit back and bomb some rappers 
 so this is like a fullblown attack im launchin at em 
 the track is on some battlin raps who wants some static 
 cause i dont really think that the fact that im slim matters 
 a plaque and platinum status is whack if im not the baddest so 
  
 til the roof comes off til the lights go out 
 til my legs give out cant shut my mouth 
 til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps 
 ima rip this shit til my bones collapse 
  til the roof comes off til the lights go out 
  til my legs give out cant shut my mouth 
  til the smoke clears out am i high perhaps 
  ima rip this shit til my bones collapse 
  
  
 until the roof  
 the roof comes off  
 until my legs  
 give out from underneath me 
 i i will not fall i will stand tall 
 feels like no one can beat me	television static

 my songs can make you cry take you by surprise 
 at the same time can make you dry your eyes 
 with the same rhyme see what youre seein 
 is a genius at work which to me isnt work 
 so its easy to misinterpret it at first cause when i speak 
 its tongueincheek id yank my fuckin teeth 
 before id ever bite my tongue id slice my gums 
 get struck by fuckin lightning twice at once 
 and die and come back as vanilla ices son 
 and walk around the rest of my life spit on 
 and kicked and hit with shit every time i sung 
 like r kelly as soon as bump and grind comes on 
 more pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl 
 inside of a plane aimed at the world trade 
 standin on ronnies grave screamin at the sky 
 til clouds gather its clyde mathers and bonnie jade 
 and thats pretty much the gist of it 
 parents are pissed but the kids love it 
 9 millimeter heaters stashed in twoseaters with meat cleavers 
 i dont blame you i wouldnt let hailie listen to me neither 
  
 theres really nothin else to say i i cant explain it 
 i think my dads gone crazy

 the only way im leavin this bitch is suicide 
 i have died clinically 
 arrived back at my enemys crib with hennessy

 physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef 
 i spark willingly with a dillinger in the dark diligently

 i cant stay away from a razor

 i wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight to awake neighbors for acres 
 ill murder you i gauge and have me turn into 
 a mad man son of sam bitch im surgical

 i was happy havin a deal at first 
 thought money would make me happy 
 but it only made my pain worse 
 it hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you dawg 
 and you aint got nothin left but your word and your balls 
 and youre stressed from the calls of your new friends 
 beggin with their hands out 
 checkin for your record when its sellin 
 when it aint thats the end no laughs no friends 
 no girls just the gin you drink til your car spin 
 you think damn when you slam into the wall and you fall 
 out the car and try to crawl with one arm 
 im bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol 
 if my funerals tomorrow wonder would they even call 
 when the music stops 
  
 lets see how many of your men loyal 
 when i pull up lookin for you with a pistol sippin a can of pennzoil 
 im revved up who said what when lead bust 
 your head just explode with red stuff 
 im handcuffed tossed in the paddywagon 
 braggin about how you shouted like a coward 
 bullets devoured you showered you niggas 
 if i was you niggas id run while given a chance 
 understand i can enhance the spirit of man 
 death itself it cant hurt me 
 just the thought of dyin alone that really irks me 
 you aint worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk 
 be smart and stop tryna walk how gs walk before we spark 
 hug the floor while we playin tugofwar wit your life 
 fuck a tour and a mic id rather fuck a whore with a knife 
 deliver that shit that coroners like 
 you hype poppin shit in broad daylight nigga youre a goner at night  
  
  
 instigators turn pits in cages 
 let loose and bit the neighbors wrist to razors 
 yall dont want war yall want talk 
 in the dark my dogs all bark like woof 
 proof nigga im a wolf 
 get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves 
 stomp the booth shake the floor tiles loose 
 the more yall breathe shit the more i moves 
 its hill streetthis is hardcore blues 
 put a gun to rap check in all our dues nigga 
 or make the news bet you all yall move 
 when the uzi pop you better drop when the music stop

 marilyn mansoni dyed my hair blue and grew some titties 
 ludacris told me to throw them bows

 brought to you in part by slim shady

 i sit back with this pack of zigzags and this bag 
 of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be 
 the most meanest mc on this on this earth 
 and since birth ive been cursed with this curse to just curse 
 and just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works 
 and it sells and it helps in itself to relieve 
 all this tension dispensin these sentences 
 gettin this stress thats been eatin me recently off 
 of this chest and i rest again peacefully  
 but at least have the decency in you 
 to leave me alone when you freaks see me out 
 in the streets when im eatin or feedin my daughter 
 to not come and speak to me  i dont know you 
 and no i dont owe you a motherfuckin thing 
 im not mr nsync im not what your friends think 
 im not mr friendly i can be a prick 
 if you tempt me my tank is on empty  
 no patience is in me and if you offend me 
 im liftin you ten feet  in the air 
 i dont care who was there and who saw me just jaw you

 with all of this nonsense its constant 
 and oh its his lyrical content 
 the song guilty conscience has gotten such rotten responses 
 and all of this controversy circles me 
 and it seems like the media immediately 
 points a finger at me  
 so i point one back at em but not the index or pinkie 
 or the ring or the thumb its the one you put up 
 when you dont give a fuck when you wont just put up 
 with the bullshit they pull cause they full of shit too 
 when a dudes gettin bullied and shoots up his school 
 and they blame it on marilyn  and the heroin

 cause they feed me the fuel that i need for the fire to burn 
 and its burnin and i have returned

 back when mark wahlberg was marky mark  
 this is how we used to make the party start 
 we used to mix hen with bacardi dark 
 and when it kicks in you can hardly talk 
 and by the sixth gin youre gon probably crawl 
 and youll be sick then and youll probably barf 
 and my prediction is youre gon probably fall 
 either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall 
 and everythings spinnin youre beginnin to think women 
 are swimmin in pink linen again in the sink then in 
 a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished 
 you are now allowed to officially slap bitches 
 you have the right to remain violent and start wilin 
 start a fight with the same guy that was smarteyein you 
 get in your car start it and start drivin 
 over the island and cause a 42car pileup 
 earth calling pilot to copilot 
 looking for life on this planet sir no sign of it 
 all i can see is a bunch of smoke flyin 
 and im so high that i might die if i go by it 
 let me outta this place im outta place 
 im in outer space ive just vanished without a trace 
 im going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow 
 ill be back in an hour or so 
  
 cause every time i go to try to leave  
 something keeps pullin on my sleeve  
 i dont wanna but i gotta stay  
 these drugs really got a hold of me  
 cause every time i try to tell em no  
 they wont let me ever let em go  
 im a sucker all i gotta say  
 these drugs really got a hold of me  
  
  
 in third grade all i used to do 
 was sniff glue through a tube and play rubiks cube 
 seventeen years later im as rude as jude 
 schemin on the first chick with the hugest boobs 
 ive got no game and every face looks the same 
 theyve got no name so i dont need game to play 
 i just say whatever i want to whoever i want 
 whenever i want wherever i want however i want 
 however i do show some respect to few 
 this ecstasys got me standin next to you 
 gettin sentimental as fuck spillin guts to you 
 we just met but i think im in love with you 
 but youre on it too so you tell me you love me too 
 wake up in the morning like yo what the fuck wed do 
 i gotta go bitch you know i got stuff to do 
 cause if i get caught cheatin then im stuck with you 
 but in the long run these drugs are probably 
 gonna catch up sooner or later but fuck it im on one 
 so lets enjoy let the x destroy your spinal cord 
 so its not a straight line no more 
 til we walk around lookin like some windup dolls 
 shits stickin out of our backs like a dinosaur 
 shit six hits wont even get me high no more 
 so bye for now im gonna try to find some more 
  
 cause every time i go to try to leave  
 something keeps pullin on my sleeve  
 i dont wanna but i gotta stay  
 these drugs really got a hold of me  
 cause every time i try to tell em no  
 they wont let me ever let em go  
 im a sucker all i gotta say  
 these drugs really got a hold of me  
  
  
 thats the sound of a bottle when its hollow 
 when you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow 
 and tomorrow youre probably gonna wanna do it again 
 whats a little spinal fluid between you and a friend 
 screw it and whats a little bit of alcohol poisonin 
 and whats a little fight tomorrow youll be boys again 
 its your life live it however you wanna 
 marijuana is everywhere where was you brought up 
 it dont matter as long as you get where youre goin 
 cause none of this shits gonna mean shit where were goin 
 they tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin 
 even though you wake up feelin like shit every mornin 
 but youre young youve got a lot of drugs to do 
 girls to screw parties to crash sucks to be you 
 if i could take it all back now i wouldnt 
 i would have did more shit that people said that i shouldnt 
 but im all grown up now and upgraded 
 and graduated to better drugs and updated 
 but i still got a lotta growing up to do 
 i still got a whole lotta throwing up to spew 
 but when its all said and done ill be forty 
 before i know it with a 40 on the porch tellin stories 
 with a bottle of jack two grandkids in my lap 
 babysittin for hailie while hailies out gettin smashed 
  
 cause every time i go to try to leave  
 something keeps pullin on my sleeve  
 i dont wanna but i gotta stay  
 these drugs really got a hold of me  
 cause every time i try to tell em no  
 they wont let me ever let em go

 life is like a big obstacle in front of your optical to slow you down 
 and every time you think youve gotten past it 
 its gonna come back around to tackle you to the damn ground 
 what are friends 
 friends are people that you think are your friends 
 but they really your enemies with secret identities 
 and disguises to hide they true colors 
 so just when you think you close enough to be brothers 
 they wanna come back and cut your throat when you aint lookin

 money is what makes a man act funny 
 money is the root of all evil 
 moneyll make them same friends come back around

 or gets your description and sketches ya 
 then connects you as the prime suspect 
 but i aint set to flee the scene of the crime just yet 
 cause i got a daughter to feed 
 and two hundred dollars aint enough to water the seed 
 the best thing would be for me to leave taco bell 
 and hit up chess king and have the lady at the desk bring 
 money from the safe in the back stepped in wavin a mac 
 cooperate and we can operate and save an attack 
 this bitch tried escapin the jack 
 grabbed her by the throat its murder she wrote

 you look insanely wack when just a fraction of my tracks runs 
 my rhymin skills got you climbin hills 
 i travel through your mind and chill your spine like siren drills 
 im slimin grills of roaches with spray that disinfects 
 and twistin necks of rappers til their spinal column disconnects 
 put this in decks and check the monologue turn your system up 
 twist em up and indulge in the marijuana smog 
 this is the season for noise pollution contamination 
 examination of more cartunes than animation 
 my lamination of narerration hits a snare and bass 
 on a track for duck rapper interrogation 
 when i declare invasion there aint no time to be starin gazin 
 i turn the stage into a barren wasteland 
 im infinite 
  
 you heard of hell well i was sent from it 
 i went to it servin a sentence for murderin instruments 
 now im tryin to repent from it but when i hear the beat 
 im tempted to make another attempt at it 
 im infinite 
  
  
 bust it i let the beat commence 
 so i can beat the sense in your elite defense 
 i got some meat to mince 
 some fruit to stomp and then two feet to rinse 
 i greet the gents and ladies i spoil loyal fans 
 i foil plans and leave fluids leakin like oil pans 
 my coiled hands around this microphone are lethal 
 one thought in my cerebral is deeper than a jeepfull of people 
 mcs are feeble i came to cause some pandemonium 
 battle a band of phony mcs and stand the lonely one 
 imitator intimidator stimulator 
 simulator of data eliminator 
 theres never been a greater since the burial of jesus 
 fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases 
 my thesisll smash a stereo to pieces 
 my acappella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis 
 it eases you mentally gently 
 sentimentally instrumentally 
 with entity dementedly meant to be infinite

 here to make a mess of a lyricsmugglin embezzler 
 no one is specialer my skill is intergalactical 
 i get cynical act a fool then i send a crew back to school 
 i never packed a tool or acted cool it wasnt practical 
 id rather let a tactical tactful track tickle your fancy 
 in fact i cant see or cant imagine 
 a man who aint a lover of beats or a fan of scratchin 
 so this is for my family the kid who had a cameo on my last jam 
 plus the man who never had a plan b be all you can be

 and tempted when i see the sins my friends commit 
 im infinite

 and make them do shit illegal for these grants and jacksons 
 these transactions explain a mans actions 
 but in the midst of this insanity i found my christianity 
 through god and theres a wish he granted me 
 he showed me how to cope with the stress 
 and hope for the best instead of mope and depressed 
 always gropin a mess of flyin over the nest 
 to sellin dope with the rest

 life is stressful inside this cesspool 
 tryin to wrestle i almost bust a blood vessel 
 my little brothers tryin to learn his mathematics 
 hes asthmatic runnin home from school away from crack addicts 
 kids attract static children with automatics 
 takin target practice on teens for starter jackets 
 im usin smarter tactics to overcome this slum 
 i wont become as dumb as some and succumb to scum 
 its cumbersome im tryin to do well on this earth 
 but its been hell on this earth since i fell on this earth

 to go to the emergency cause it burns to pee 
 dont bring your germs to me cause i aint tryna hear it

 and unveil one of his kids

  beat a bitch snake from the hood 
 haha come here you fuckin backstabber

 sneezin at dust and swingin at the spider webs 
 inside the depths of his basement 
 i taste lint in my mouth 
 then the lights in the place went 
 i saw my life flash in front of my eyes 
 i felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs

 so just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it 
  
 you fuckinoh 
 and im just playin diddy 
 you know i love you	im possessed by evil demons that torture me while im sleeping 
 i keep dreaming of death and im hearing people screaming 
 the devils spirits trapped inside me and i want it out 
 im on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house 
 with both of my wrists slit im lifted up in the air 
 and suspended in animation like someones holding me there 
 i feel somebodys cold hands wrapping around my neck 
 while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death 
 but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches 
 nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes 
 tripping over odd bodies of dead lushes 
 bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes 
 doors open and close by themselves 
 books fly off shelves curtains catch fire the house melts 
 my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters 
 the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters 
 caught a piece of shrapnel in the adams apple 
 two cups of holy water and im looking at em half full 
 but as soon as i go to touch em they turn into red rum 
 it got silent then all these voices said 
 come follow me into the gates of hell 
 i heard em yell welcome to the norman bates motel 
 i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother 
 covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel 
 i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest 
 she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess 
 and told me thats just for starters satanll be in to see me later 
 to see if im interested in being partners	it is not about lyrics anymore 
 its about a hot beat and a catchy hook 
  
  
 if we gotta dumb down our style and abc it 
 then so be it cause nowadays these kids just 
 dont give a shit bout lyrics 
 all they wanna hear is a beat and thats it 
 long as they can go to the club and get blitzed 
 pick up some chicks and get some digits 
 and the djs playing them hits 
 oh this my jam this my shit 
 we dont know a word to a verse all we know is the chorus 
 cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us 
 and the songs ginormous the whole formulas switched 
 cause we dont know anymore what are hits 
 is it the beat is it the rap 
 is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap 
 and how do we adapt and get trl votes 
 when thirteenyearolds control the remotes 
 and ashlees got a brand new nose 
 we gotta put some new emphasis on our syllalables 
  
  
 if the emphasis on the compact disc 
 is in the beat then im gon feature em and get rich 
 and let dre mix the shit and drive off in the range ro 
 cause everywhere i go they love the blingbling flow 
 bangbang look at the way my chain glow 
 the ring on my fing cost your man a lot of dough  
 the fuck am i bustin my brain fo 
 its just the way the game go and oh it takes two to tango 
 you call this a lame flow you bought the shit 
 i guess you to blame too i just found an angle  
 no more reality flow 
 im tryna time my album dropping with a reality show 
 cock the mac11 in front of hot 97 
 and call my publicist tell her we in press heaven  
 no one gives a shit except 
 some kids that just got into sex on the internet 
 so you want the chatroom or the house in malibu 
 em your emphasis is on the wrong syllalable 
  
 they said thirtys the new twenty funny 
 must mean fortys the new thirty interesting 
 cause ever since then its been in a sense an extension 
 for veteran rappers that are better than half of 
 the shit coming out right now its all trash 
 the torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed 
 jay said its his last then 50 and em 
 then what detox drops what do we got then 
 so now our whole camps is running around 
 scrambling over what to do 
 gambling every time we put a record out 
 just lookin for that hook

 and doody its true you brought people together 
 who never woulda been in the same room if it wasnt for you

 but you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding 
 but you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin 
 if it had to happen it had to happen

 from eggin cars to paintballin gettin arrested

 speaking of masks man it aint too late to have a change of pace 
 and take it off and show my face so you can see the things you face

 he may seem as though hes plain normal if you ever meet him 
 greet him with a shake see he aint as mean as what they say 
 see the thing is maybe he cant always think of things to say 
 so hes vague so they mistake him for bein crazed 
 you part ways your impression of him changed 
 you dont think hes strange you turn around and tell him peace and thanks 
 you catch him flippin you off with his pants down 
 hands around his scrotum tuckin his fuckin penis between his legs

 what if i told you that i was different 
 what if i told you that somethingsmissin 
 andwhat if itold you were not alike 
 and theway that i feel inside is different than what you picture 
 what if i told you i feel divided 
 keep to myself and im awfully quiet 
 and what if i told you i been conflicted by my own thoughts 
 trapped in the dark and i tried to hide it 
 no im not a slave to no fuckin fairy tale 
 i bet you think that you know me very well 
 make no mistake this is not a cry for help 
 cause i dont owe no one no explanation on how i feel 
  
  
 but on the real what if i told you that i was brave 
 i grew up different than i was raised 
 but still what if i told you im out of place wait 
 what if i told you that i was gay 
  
  
 duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh 
 duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh 
 duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh 
 duh nuh 
 duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh 
 duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh 
 duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh

 yeah 
 what if i told you im not alright 
 i mean i dont feel dead but im not alive 
 and what if i told you im not like you 
 and the shit ive been goin through itll prolly make you cry 
 and what if i told you im not this 
 and the person you think you know dont exist 
 look im not who you know im not who you wish 
 im not who you want me to be what you want from me isnt this 
 i grew up in church where i couldnt be myself 
 i felt like a prisoner couldnt leave my cell 
 they told me god dont like ugly and this an ugly world 
 and if i ever seen things different then i would burn in hell 
  
  
 and on the real this is not new this is not a phase 
 i grew up different than i was raised 
 but still what if i told you im out of place wait 
 what if i told you that i was gay 
  
  
 duh nuh duh nuh nuh duh

 what if i told you im homophobic 
 and you have zero control over your impulses 
 and the genetic flaw in your chromosomes is the culprit 
 its something i cant sugarcoat its repulsive 
 we were homies since children i thought it 
 but thought i was buggin though 
 cause wed sit chill and just talk chicks 
 now how can we be friends still after all this 
 unless i can convince you to repent 
 ask god to forgive you for your sins 
 and begin healin your conscience 
 and rid you of this sick illness that causes it 
 part of me wishes youd kept this shit still in the closet 
 im white but im gettin mixed feelings like logic 
 yeah im pissed off a little this is a choice 
 we were supposed to be boys 
 youre actin like this aint optional 
 what if i said you was weak 
 cause you dont got the strength to conquer some biological monster thats part of you 
 thats responsible for them homosexual thoughts 
 if you dont want a lecture part 
 like a sofa section or long as you 
 make your decision and stand by it but i cant be beside it 
 cause for me thatd be next to impossible 
 or you learn to control your urges 
 you say its like pullin teeth and morals are oral surgeons 
 but how would you even know anyways if youre a virgin 
 why cant you be a normal person 
 what if i tried steerin you towards a girlfriend 
 wouldnt work would it you seem pretty surefooted 
 im sure good at judgin but i have no right 
 i know goodbye seems cold right 
 not even a flicker of hope like a strobe light 
 as i leave and i swear i stayed up that whole night 
 and no i didnt know you would go right home and go take your own life 
 i aint mean for that shit to happen i said i wont cry 
 i let the best friend that ive ever known die 
 alone was gonna tell you the next day 
 im so sorry im fightin my own demons i wont lie 
 they wont leave me alone eating at my soul this whole time 
 ive been tortured imprisoned in my own mind 
 a born again christian but lord if youre listenin 
 we might be headed for a collision 
 cause when i told my boy i couldnt support his decision 
 i was tryna make it seem like a choice when it isnt 
 cant be cured with a prayer to saint jude 
 what if i told you my wish never came true 
 what if im a hypocrite whos afraid to just face truth wait 
 what if i told you im gay too

 yo alright

 im possessed by evil demons that torture me while im sleeping 
 i keepdreamingof death andim hearing people screaming 
 the devils spiritstrapped inside me and i want it out 
 im on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house 
 with both of my wrists slit im lifted up in the air 
 and suspended in animation like someones holding me there 
 im feeling somebodys cold hands wrapping around my neck 
 while i choke on my own blood that i swallow and drown to death 
 but i found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches 
 nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes 
 tripping over odd bodies of dead lushes 
 bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red slushies 
 doors open and close by themselves books fly off shelves 
 curtains catch fire the house melts 
 my skin blisters and sticks together like twin sisters 
 the wind blows and shatters windows like ten twisters 
 caught a piece of shrapnel in the adams apple 
 two cups of holy water and im looking at em half full 
 but as soon as i go to touch em they turn into red rum 
 it got silent then all these voices said come 
 follow me into the gates of hell 
 i heard em yell welcome to the norman bates motel 
 i ring the bell for service and i was greeted by his mother 
 covered in dry blood head still dented from the shovel 
 i said i need a room so i could try to get some rest 
 she gave me the keys to the best suite and a bag of cess 
 and told me thats just for starters 
 satanll be in to see me later to see to if im interested in being partners	yo man yo marsh man 
 yo youve been kickin all this shit about yourself 
 what of the homies man 
 oh you want one about the posse alright 
  
  
 ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride 
 oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride 
  
  
 well foolish pride has a lot of things to say 
 you got foolish pride like you got tooth decay 
 but tooth decay is another problem 
 so lets take this ole foolish pride problem and solve it 
 now when i talk about foolish pride 
 i mean blacks and whites taking different sides 
 when blacks and whites take different sides 
 unity never happens and we will subside 
 we will subside and hatred will release 
 and everything will just crush that peace 
 but when we crush that peace you see we start hatin each other 
 but remember you are my brother and you are my sister 
 just like im a mister 
 i seen a black girlfriend and i kissed her 
 i kissed her i placed it on her cheek 
 and she didnt come back til next week 
 now it was next week and she was back again 
 wanting to kiss a white kid 
 so she was my girlfriend we started going out 
 but thats okay because we were black and white 
 blacks and whites sometimes mix 
 but black girls only want your money cause theyre dumb chicks 
 so ima say like this 
 dont date a black girl take it as a diss 
 if you want but if you dont 
 ima tell you like this i surely wont 
 never date a black girl because blacks only want your money 
 and that shit aint funny 
 so ima say look honey 
 why do you do this 
 you know you step up to me like you a brutus 
 then you try to grab my spinach 
 because its green and thats cash 
 so get outta here cause i dont need your ass 
 i said that before but thats okay because like i said youre a whore 
 black girls and white girls just dont mix 
 because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks 
 white girls are good i like white girls 
 i like white girls all over the world 
 white girls are fine and they blow my mind 
 and thats why im here now telling you this rhyme 
 cause black girls i really dont like 
 we dont mix its like riding a bike 
 when youre peddling hard uphill both ways 
 you know its kinda hard and thats why i say to you 
 im giving you a little advice 
 dont date a black girl if you do it once you wont do it twice 
 you wont ever do it again because theyll take your money 
 and that aint funny 
 so ima say look honey 
 ive already said that before 
 but like i said again youre nothing but a big whore 
 so when mike catch on the bass line 
 thats okay cause we will not just waste time 
 ill get straight to the point black girls are bitches 
 thats why ima tell you you better pull up your britches 
 cause all that cash is making your ass drag 
 from the boyfriend you ganked and thats pretty bad 
 i mean thats pretty sad when youre dating a black guy 
 and then you turn around and fuck another big black guy 
 now thats pretty wrong but youre just ganking 
 but thats okay because you need a god damn spanking 
 from me the funky mm 
 im busting rhymes and im swallowing phlegm 
 im busting a freestyle just like this 
 i say swallowing phlegm and howard gets pissed 
 but when howard gets pissed thats okay 
 because he leaves and he doesnt show up for two more days 
 so ill just worry about that problem when i come to it 
 ill cross that bridge when i come to it 
 cause i forgot the chorus 
 but thats okay cause yall saying bust a rhyme for us 
 so ima bust another rhyme about this black girl 
 she turned out to be a fuckin wack girl 
 a wack girl because black girls aint funny 
 all they want is your goddamn money 
 they take you for everything youve got 
 and then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand 
 so ima kick it to you just like this 
 how does the chorus go i forgot 
 but thats okay cause ima tell you in stride 
 ima say ole foolish pride 
  
 ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride 
 oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride 
 oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh ole foolish pride 
 oh oh oh ole foolish pride oh oh oh

 and theres no risk of disease cause he aint with anyone is he 
 this bitch really thinks she can get me 
 if she still wants me driving across country 
 strapped up to the front seat missing all her front teeth 
 thinking to herself whens the next time hes gonna punch me 
 i told this cunt shes gonna overdo it once 
 and once she does shell be stuffed up in a trunk 
 crunchy scrunched her up in a ball 
 bunched up nice and comfy 
 fuck around get dumped up in a lake fore you dump me

 i feel like a serial killer i keep dumping bodies in the lake 
 imma get caught and sent up the river 
 i shiver when i think of the company i keep 
 how do i know she aint gonna kill me when i sleep 
 i shriek every time she hands me something to drink 
 sex kept us together when we slept together everything 
 was all better she made me feel like a king 
 slowly she began lowering my selfesteem 
 shed go to the club and not answer the phone when i call her 
 and i just bought her a truck for 50000 dollars 
 accused me of doing drugs and scream and holla 
 then i find a bag of coke on her some marijuana 
 and all i know is every time i go 
 to them hiding spots wherever she hides her blow 
 the little bags of dope there was a pile of coke 
 thats growing smaller and that was just a while ago 
 and i wouldnt even let on like i know 
 what was i supposed to do call her out on it wed just argue 
 say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script 
 ooh shes a manipulative evil bitch 
 a cunning little cunt little deceitful witch 
 she thought she had me till my shrink told me this 
  
  
 the problem is all inside your head she said to me 
 the answer is easy if you take it logically 
 id like to help you in your struggle to be free

 id never drag them in battles that i can handle unless i absolutely have to 
 im supposed to set an example 
 i need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em 
 if some shit ever does pop off im supposed to be beside em 
 that ja shit i tried to squash it it was too late to stop it 
 theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it 
 i heard him say hailies name on a song and i just lost it 
 it was crazy this went way beyond some jayz and nas shit 
 and even though the battle was won i feel like we lost it 
 i spent too much energy on it honestly im exhausted 
 and im so caught in it i almost feel im the one who caused it 
 this aint what im in hiphop for its not why i got in it

 well its not if your little fickle minds wouldve caught on but you didnt 
 see i dont rap for the green i mean i aint greedy 
 but i also know what its like to be needy and i will never 
 go back to poverty see it aint easy to try to step 
 away from entertainment separate it from cds

 meat eaters they gotta give you something to read 
 or you wont buy it believe what you wanna believe 
 let em feed to you the bs ps peace to ti 
 you gon be aight and we out 
  
 everything i do is number one that makes you two 
 and that spells trouble for me and you 
 cause thats how beef starts between crews 
 and i dont mind if i debut at number two 
 so why do you if we make money 
 then why cant you be satisfied with what you do
