# Project: Fine-Tuning GPT-Neo 125M on Toy Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to fine-tune the GPT-Neo 125M model, a smaller variant of the GPT-Neo family designed for causal language modeling tasks. The model is fine-tuned on a toy dataset provided in the data folder, which consists of MNMLyrics data. The primary purpose of this project is experimental learning and to familiarize users with the fine-tuning process using the Hugging Face Transformers library. It is not intended to surpass state-of-the-art models or achieve top accuracy metrics.

Dataset
The toy dataset, comprised of MNMLyrics, can be found within the data folder. This dataset is a minimal set used for demonstration purposes and to enable quick experimentation.

Setup
To set up the project for training and inference, follow the steps outlined below:

Environment Setup:

Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed on your system.
Install required Python packages using pip:
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation:

Place your training data inside the data directory.
Ensure the data is formatted properly for consumption by the model.
Training:

The script train.py is provided for fine-tuning the model.
Adjust hyperparameters within the script as needed for your specific training setup.
To initiate training, run the script:
sh
Copy code
python train.py
Inference:

The script inference.py can be used to generate text using the fine-tuned model.
Execute the script to test the outputs of your model:
sh
Copy code
python inference.py
Project Structure
data/ - Contains the toy dataset used for fine-tuning.
train.py - Script for fine-tuning the GPT-Neo 125M model.
inference.py - Script for generating text with the fine-tuned model.
requirements.txt - Lists the dependencies required to run the project.
Model
The project utilizes the GPT-Neo 125M model from the EleutherAI/gpt-neo-125M configuration. This model is a transformer-based neural network designed for natural language understanding and generation tasks.
